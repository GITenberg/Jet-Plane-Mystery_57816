<br /><span class="h2line2">WHISTLING MYSTERY</span></h2>
<p>Ensign Jack Steel sat on the edge of a life raft
whittling a stick. A strange place to whittle,
one might say, on the deck of a great U. S. aircraft
carrier in mid-Pacific. But Jack loved to whittle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make when you whittle?&rdquo; someone
once asked him. &ldquo;Shavings&mdash;just shavings&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; had been his prompt reply. Then, feeling that
this was not a real answer, he went on to say, &ldquo;I
whittle and think. Thinking is what really counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was thinking now, not thinking hard&mdash;just
letting thoughts drift in and out of his mind. There
was enough to think about, too; they were in Jap
waters right now. Something was bound to happen
soon, perhaps at dawn. Jack would be away before
dawn, for his was a scout plane. Back at the faraway
training base at Kingsville he had put in his bid for
a dive bomber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! A dive bomber!&rdquo; he had said to Stew, his
buddy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the plane for me! You climb to
twelve thousand feet, you get near the target, you
come zooming down at four hundred an hour, you
let go your bomb, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wham!&rdquo; Stew had exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack had agreed. &ldquo;Then you get out of
there fast, as if Old Nick himself was after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Navy you don&rsquo;t talk back; so when the
powers that be read off Jack, or &ldquo;Jackknife Johnny,&rdquo;
as some of the boys called him, for a scout ship, a
scout ship it had been&mdash;and still was.</p>
<p>And now, Jack thought, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my little
old scout plane for any ship that flies. To go skimming
away before dawn, to watch the &ldquo;dawn come
up like thunder&rdquo; in those tropical waters, then to
skip from cloud to cloud, eyes ever on the sea, looking
for the enemy&mdash;ah, that was the life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it!&rdquo; he whispered as he carved off
a long shaving and allowed it to drop silently on
the deck.</p>
<p>A moving shadow loomed up before him. He
knew that shadow&mdash;&ldquo;Old Ironsides,&rdquo; as the boys
called him&mdash;Lieutenant Commander Donald Stone,
boss of the carrier <i>Black Bee</i>, Jack&rsquo;s ship, was on
his way to the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must get a swell view of our task force from up
there, eh, Commander?&rdquo; Jack spoke before he
thought. He&rsquo;d always been that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? What? Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Jackknife Johnny.&rdquo; The
Commander gave a low laugh. &ldquo;Well now, on a
night like this you don&rsquo;t see much&mdash;a bit of white
foam after each ship, and a blink of light now and
then&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough, sir,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s
there&mdash;cruisers, destroyers, and maybe a tanker.
Your mind must fill in the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It does! It really does!&rdquo; the Commander
agreed. &ldquo;Want to come up and see for yourself?&rdquo;
he invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be keen, sir!&rdquo; said Jack, dropping
to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on up then,&rdquo; the Commander urged.</p>
<p>As Jack mounted the steps to the Commander&rsquo;s
bridge, twenty-five feet above the flight deck, he
thought how strange life aboard a carrier would
seem to those who had never put to sea as a navy
pilot. Routine was strictly adhered to. When a flight
of planes came in from a practice flight, they came
down in perfect formation like a flock of wild geese
landing on a pond.</p>
<p>Strict discipline, yes, he told himself, yet here I
am following our Commander to his bridge, and it
doesn&rsquo;t seem a bit strange; for he&rsquo;s one of us. We&rsquo;re
all one, all dressed in khaki, all tanned, trained to
the last degree, ready to act as a unit to beat the Japs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Life on a carrier surely is grand, sir!&rdquo; he said
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, son,&rdquo; the hardy old Commander rumbled.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been anything like it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never has, sir,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Commander as they reached
the bridge, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your Navy task force on a moonless
night. Have a seat. Take it all in. I&rsquo;m going to
do a little meditating on the reality of the Absolute.&rdquo;
He laughed, and Jack laughed with him. Jack
didn&rsquo;t know who or what the Absolute might be,
but he did know that the Commander was giving
him a real treat, and that was enough for him.</p>
<p>It was strange sitting up there feeling the throb
of the ship&rsquo;s mighty engines, looking away at the
blacker-than-black sea, and knowing that they were
racing along at twenty knots an hour toward some
sort of real trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooky,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>And indeed, it was just that, for they were definitely
in Jap waters. Everyone expected a fight at
dawn. If some Jap snooper plane or submarine
sighted them now, there would be a mighty battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>To the right and a little ahead he caught a white
gleam on the water. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the <i>Black Knight</i>,&rdquo; he
told himself. The <i>Black Knight</i> was a fast and powerful
cruiser. Three other cruisers, always close to
the carrier but not too close, sped along with them.
Six destroyers lay farther out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of power, sir!&rdquo; Jack said aloud as the
Commander strode past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Yes, a lot of striking power,&rdquo; the Commander
agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re likely to need it, too. They
say the Jap navy won&rsquo;t come out and fight. You
can&rsquo;t count on that. They&rsquo;re sly rascals, those Japs.
They might pounce on us with double our striking
power any time. They....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, sir?&rdquo; Jack broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; The Commander paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear it, sir?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the
howl of a dog, or a train whistle far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I hear is that banjo on the after deck,&rdquo; the
Commander laughed low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, nor anything like it.&rdquo; Jack was in
dead earnest. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing on this ship. It comes
from far away, sir. Listen hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have good ears,&rdquo; said the Commander. &ldquo;Radio
ears, perhaps. They say there are people who
can pick radio messages right out of the air with
their unaided ears. I&rsquo;ve never believed that, but&mdash;say!&rdquo;
His voice rose. &ldquo;I think I do hear something
out there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you do, sir!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting
louder, closer!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>For a space of seconds the two of them, the aged
Commander and the boy, stood there listening with
breathless attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be serious!&rdquo; the Commander exclaimed
at last, as he dashed for the intership telephone.</p>
<p>Jack heard him barking words into the phone. He
at last exclaimed loud enough to be heard, &ldquo;Good
boy, Steve! Keep a sharp watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack wondered who Steve was, but more than that
he wanted to know what made that high-pitched,
screaming whistle that had increased in volume until
it fairly filled the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bomb!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Sounds just
like the ones those Jap dive bombers threw at us!&rdquo;
He wanted to race down the companionway to seek
a safer spot. And then again he did not, for was not
this a first-class mystery? And was not the Commander
standing by? You had to be a real sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be a bomb from some stratosphere plane,&rdquo;
the Commander, who had returned to his post,
agreed. &ldquo;But I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it then, sir?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Jap trick I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; the Commander rumbled.
&ldquo;They may be closer than we think. The Germans
claim they&rsquo;ve got planes loaded with TNT
that they guide by radio. It might be one of those.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>From below came the murmur of many voices.
All over the ship men were calling, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; &ldquo;Here it comes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Here she
comes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack wondered if they would be ordered to battle
stations, but no order came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s high up and coming fast.&rdquo; There was a suggestion
of huskiness in the Commander&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will pass over quickly, sir,&rdquo; Jack declared.
&ldquo;Unless....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the Commander agreed.</p>
<p>To Jack, whose mind often conjured up strange
things, all that lay about him&mdash;the night, the black
sea, the tiny lights blinking in from nowhere, and
the eerie scream from the night sky&mdash;seemed part
of another world.</p>
<p>The Commander took a more practical view of it.
&ldquo;Maybe a meteor,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A meteor!&rdquo; Jack was startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a shooting star that&rsquo;s burned its way through
the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not finish, for all of a sudden he realized
that the thing, whatever it might be, had passed
directly over their heads and was now speeding east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s gone by!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Danger&rsquo;s
over.&rdquo; He experienced intense relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; was the Commander&rsquo;s strange reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! that was fast, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast?&rdquo; the Commander added in a lower tone.
&ldquo;Faster than any plane you&rsquo;ve ever flown, Jack my
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it, sir,&rdquo; Jack laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or ever will fly,&rdquo; the Commander added.</p>
<p>In this last statement he was entirely wrong, as
future events were to prove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d want to ride a meteor, sir?&rdquo; Jack asked
with another laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meteor? Oh, yes. Quite a wild guess on my part,&rdquo;
said the Commander. &ldquo;A meteor speeding through
the air would glow with the heat created by friction.
You didn&rsquo;t see anything, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, sir. Whatever it might be, it&rsquo;s
black as night itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo; The Commander sighed a
moment later when the last faint whistle had died
away in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one of those things, sir,&rdquo; Jack agreed. At
that he wondered whether he had spoken the truth.
Or will there be more of them, many more? he wondered.
And will one of them at last make contact
with the broad side of the old <i>Black Bee</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, oh boy!&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;That
would be something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>A moment more of vast, black silence, and he was
excusing himself to go down the ladder to join his
buddies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to turn in, sir,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the Commander agreed. &ldquo;Tomorrow
may be a great day for us all. You never know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CONTACT</span></h2>
<p>On the flight deck Jack joined a group of his
fighting pals. Sprawled about the deck, they
were still discussing the mysterious something that
had gone screaming over their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Jap trick,&rdquo; said Dave Dunn, a torpedo
bomber pilot. &ldquo;I tell you they&rsquo;re closer than you
think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have to be too close at that,&rdquo; Jack
broke in. &ldquo;I was on the Commander&rsquo;s bridge when
the thing went over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho! Listen to Jackie!&rdquo; Kentucky, a fighter
pilot, exclaimed. &ldquo;Been hobnobbin&rsquo; with the Commander!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Ken!&rdquo; Red Sands, another fighter pilot,
gave him a push. &ldquo;What does the Commander think
about it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sign. That&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo; a bombardier exclaimed.
&ldquo;Sign of trouble ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Commander thinks just what we all think.&rdquo;
Jack gave a low chuckle as he dropped to the deck.
&ldquo;Might be just anything&mdash;a meteor, a Jap nuisance
trick&mdash;just anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuisance trick! Say! If that thing had hit us I&rsquo;ll
say it would have been a nuisance!&rdquo; Blackie, another
fighter, exclaimed.</p>
<p>The talk went on, but Jack, who for the moment
had lost interest in the sky-screamer, was talking
with his pal, Stew Sherman, radio gunner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commander thinks we&rsquo;ll contact a Jap task
force tomorrow,&rdquo; he confided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; Stew murmured softly.</p>
<p>Unlike Jack, who was tall, slim, blond, and quick
as the snap of a jackknife blade, Stew was short,
solid, and rather quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message was picked up from a land-based
plane,&rdquo; Jack continued. &ldquo;He was reporting back to
his own base. That base is a long way from here, but
those big old land-snoopers cruise long distances.
He was reporting a Jap task force headed south.
Sounds like action ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our turn next,&rdquo; Stew grumbled. &ldquo;Last time
Louie and Dave spotted the Jappies. <i>We&rsquo;ll</i> find &rsquo;em
this time, or bust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure will!&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means we&rsquo;d better turn in,&rdquo; Stew suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>They were on their feet, when suddenly the
squeaky notes of a badly played violin reached Jack&rsquo;s
ears. &ldquo;Oh! Ouch!&rdquo; he exclaimed in mock pain.</p>
<p>The two boys wandered back to find Ted Armour,
a fighter pilot, doing his best to murder
&ldquo;Turkey in the Straw.&rdquo; Ted was the son of a rich
stockbroker, but a real fellow for all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Pete&rsquo;s sake, tune that fiddle!&rdquo; Jack exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tune it yourself!&rdquo; Ted held out the violin.
&ldquo;How are you going to do it without a piano?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without troubling to reply, Jack accepted the
challenge. Tucking the fiddle under his chin, he
began strumming its strings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... Now!&rdquo; He exclaimed once. Then,
&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s better!&rdquo; He hummed a tune, tested
a string, hummed again; then, after drawing the
bow across the strings, exclaimed softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad! Not bad! Really quite a fiddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little you know about that!&rdquo; someone laughed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a scout pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; Jack laughed. Then, after one more
testing of the strings&mdash;seeming to forget his surroundings,
the racing carrier, the black sea, the murmuring
men&mdash;he began to play the &ldquo;Londonderry
Air.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>At once the group became silent. Even the great
ship&rsquo;s motors seemed to throb in a strange, new way
as the plaintive strain drifted out into the night.</p>
<p>Jack played it through to the end, while many
a boy far from home seemed to hear the voice of
a woman singing the sweet and melancholy words
of &ldquo;Danny Boy.&rdquo; Finishing, he purposely made a
harsh discord, then gave the violin back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! Bravo!&rdquo; came in a chorus. &ldquo;More! More!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Ted held out the violin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours, for
keeps. If you can make it do that, it belongs to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo; Jack stared in
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do.&rdquo; Ted spoke soberly. &ldquo;Dad paid
good money for that violin. It was wasted as far as
I&rsquo;m concerned. But you can really play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Jack could play. From his eighth birthday
on, he had known but one ambition&mdash;to become a
really fine violinist. Then had come the war, and&mdash;but
why think of that? The war was here. He was a
scout pilot.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood silently thinking. Then
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what.&rdquo; His voice was low and full of
emotion. &ldquo;You wanted my radio. I&rsquo;ll swap you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a go,&rdquo; Ted agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Then, fearing that his first tune had dug too deep
into the souls of his comrades, Jack struck out with
the old &ldquo;Virginia Reel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the whole gang was whirling about in a
mad sort of dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concert&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed at last, tucking
the violin under his arm. &ldquo;Tomorrow we fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow we fight! Tomorrow we fight!&rdquo; came
echoing back. And so the party broke up.</p>
<p>Jack had the precious violin, acquired in such a
strange manner, tucked under his arm as he and
Stew strode down the deck toward the ladder that
led to a night&rsquo;s repose.</p>
<p>As they rounded a life raft someone blinked a
faint light upon them. &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s you, Jack?&rdquo; It was
the Commander who spoke. He was off for a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir.&rdquo; Jack grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a violin?&rdquo; The Commander halted. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t
you playing back there on the deck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I was, sir,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;Trying
to play, I mean. You see, sir, I haven&rsquo;t touched a
violin in months. It&mdash;well&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t seem to fit in
with my program. You see, sir, I really worked at
my fiddling from the time I was eight. Then&mdash;well,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know. The war came along. And you
went all out for Uncle Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that, sir,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the proper spirit,&rdquo; the Commander approved.
&ldquo;But let me tell you something, son. You&rsquo;ll
be a better flier longer if you go back to that violin
for an hour or two every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; The boy voiced his
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever draw a string tight and leave it for a long
time?&rdquo; the Commander asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It snapped, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s the same with fliers. It&rsquo;s the fellow
with one string, one thought, who snaps first.
Relax, Jack my boy. Relax with your fiddle and
you&rsquo;ll ride through this war right into a concert
hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds a bit strange. But I&rsquo;ll try it, sir,&rdquo; Jack
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night and good hunting to you tomorrow.&rdquo;
The Commander disappeared.</p>
<p>Before turning in, Jack took a closer look at his
new treasure, his precious violin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a honey,&rdquo; he
told Stew. &ldquo;Bet it cost a thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not,&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a thousand dollars
to a man like Ted&rsquo;s dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;Seems sort of wonderful,
doesn&rsquo;t it, that you and I who&rsquo;ve never had
a lot of anything, and Kentucky and Red, who&rsquo;ve
had even less, should be messin&rsquo; round with fellows
like Ted and two or three other rich guys on the
old <i>Black Bee</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re all in the same boat, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
Stew drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the same-sized Jap bullet will down
one of them just as quick as it will one of us. For
all that,&rdquo; Jack paused, &ldquo;it looks as if ours should be
a better world to live in after the war is over, all of
us getting along together the way we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It will!&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s one bombardier
who&rsquo;s going to try to be around when it&rsquo;s
over. Fight hard, but take no fool chances, that&rsquo;s my
motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine too,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got folks waiting
for me back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. And besides, we can&rsquo;t help Uncle
Sam much down there in Davy Jones&rsquo;s locker.&rdquo; At
that they lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Jack slept with his violin that night, and next
morning before dawn he stowed it away in his plane.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Red&rsquo;s got a dog he
takes along. Blackie carries a parrot, and Bill, a
monkey. A violin makes just as good a mascot, and
not half the bother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>When he and Stew worked their way to the flight
deck that morning they found it crowded with
planes. The <i>Black Bee</i> was one of the largest carriers
in the Navy and carried more than a hundred
planes.</p>
<p>Because they required only a short run to clear
the deck, and also because in case of an attack they
must be the first ships up, the fighters stood in front
of all the others on the deck. Back of these were
scout planes; next rode dive bombers; and last of
all, torpedo planes.</p>
<p>Already the air was filled with the roar of motors
warming up. Fighters would soon be taking off for
a look at the skies close at hand and for practice runs.
Scout planes would cut the sky into a great four-hundred-mile-wide
pie and each would take its own
sector of air and sea for a close search. Lucky the
scout-ship pilot who could announce, &ldquo;Enemy task
force a hundred miles north by east.&rdquo; Even the discoverer
of a Jap snooper, a huge four-motored flying
boat, would receive his reward, and besides, with
luck, might send the air giant flaming into the sea.
Little wonder then that Jack&rsquo;s fingers trembled as
he gripped the controls and waited for the flight
officer&rsquo;s signal for the take-off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Slowly at first, then more swiftly, their wheels
rolled across the deck until they glided out over
the dark, gray waters into the approaching dawn.</p>
<p>They climbed a thousand, two, three, five thousand
feet. Jack examined and tested his instruments.
Stew swung his machine guns back and forth. Then
pressing the button, he sent a burst of fire into the
limitless blue-gray of the sky. &ldquo;This is our day!&rdquo;
Jack exulted. &ldquo;I feel it in my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Stew grumbled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re due
for some luck. Three months in the Pacific and we
haven&rsquo;t sighted a single snooper or sneaking Jap
ship. It&rsquo;s rotten luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, there&rsquo;ll come a time,&rdquo; Jack sang. He
was in fine spirits. The feel of violin strings under
his fingers had done things to him. And besides,
there was much more involved in that simple ceremony
of swapping a cheap radio for a priceless violin
than the onlookers realized. He and the fighter
Ted Armour had a secret all their own.</p>
<p>The two boys in their scout plane flew straight
away for some time. Fighter planes would guard the
air close to their task force. At last they began crisscrossing
the sky. Each time, as they went farther out
to sea and their sectors widened, their crisscrosses
increased in length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading into a mess of black clouds,&rdquo; Stew
grumbled. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be able to see a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so thick, at that,&rdquo; Jack called back cheerfully.
&ldquo;Wait until the sun is up and you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon dark clouds turned purple, faded into dark
red, then pink, to take on at last the fluffy white
of full day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a day for duck hunting!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say!&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;But give me Japs, not
ducks! The things they did to our prisoners in the
Philippines make my blood boil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine too. I&rsquo;m aching to get a crack at them.
We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Off there to the east!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ships!&rdquo; Stew exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep! And we&rsquo;ve got no task force out there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck into that long white cloud, quick!&rdquo; Stew
suggested.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s head was in a whirl as he gripped the controls,
banked his plane, then vanished from sight
into the cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contact,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Contact at
last! And there&rsquo;ll be a fight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FRIENDLY ENEMIES</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, oh boy!&rdquo; Stew exulted as they slid into
the cloud. He set his radio with trembling
fingers. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we score a scoop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Jack warned. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t risk a false
alarm. Might pull the entire task force off its course
for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was thinking. What a lovely cloud this is!
There&rsquo;s sure to be a carrier in that Jap convoy down
there, if they&rsquo;re really Jap ships&mdash;a carrier and
Zeros. There&rsquo;s sure to be a fight, and this ship of
ours is good for only 260 M.P.H. at most! But this
is what she was built for, and what we were trained
for. This is our zero hour. He drew in three deep
breaths of air and felt better. Jitters, he decided.
They all get them. Old Ironsides says we&rsquo;d be no
good if we didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Stew had not advised going into a cloud without
a reason. They were still some distance from the
task force&mdash;too far to be sure of anything. By following
it in the cloud they could obtain a better view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The cloud was miles long and appeared to dip
down toward the sea. They were constantly running
into thin filmy fringes and being obliged to drop
lower. They didn&rsquo;t want to be spotted by a Zero.
Not yet. They must make sure that this was really
a Jap task force, and get in a report. Then let the
Zeros come if they would. They&rsquo;d give them a grand
exhibition of cloud hopping and, if need be, a glorious
shooting match as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shooting if we can help it,&rdquo; Jack told himself.
&ldquo;Our job is to spot the enemy task force and
sit above them, sending in reports until our bombers
and torpedo planes come to attack. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke off sharply. What was this he
was hearing? A high-pitched whistle like a country
fire alarm. No doubt about it. It was on the same
key as the one they had heard the night before. Stew
had heard it too&mdash;Jack could tell by the look in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Jap trick!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed, gripping the
controls hard. &ldquo;Got to be ready for anything!&rdquo; Stew
was swinging his gun about as a ballplayer swings
his bat before a try at the ball.</p>
<p>The screaming noise increased. It filled the air,
and seemed almost upon them. Acting by instinct,
Jack went into a sudden steep dive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The next instant he looked up to see a shadowy
bulk shoot through the misty clouds above them
to lose itself at terrific speed in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Stew, with a shudder, &ldquo;was a torpedo.
The Japs shot it at us. If it had connected we
wouldn&rsquo;t be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>There was little time for wondering, for suddenly
they were out of the clouds, not far from the
sea. And directly beneath them lay the enemy task
force. So near was it that it looked almost like a
cardboard display against a field of blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zeros!&rdquo; Stew warned suddenly. &ldquo;Three of them
over to the left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack dipped a wing, touched the accelerator, cut
an astonishingly short circle, and re-entered the same
cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann to Mary! Ann to Mary!&rdquo; Stew repeated in
a strained voice, talking into his mike. &ldquo;Enemy task
force southeast, hundred and eighty miles. One carrier,
five cruisers, eight destroyers, and three cargo
ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited ten seconds. He, you have guessed, was
Ann. The operator on the carrier was Mary. Twice,
at brief intervals, he repeated the messages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;Watch it!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed, banking his plane so
sharply it stood on a wing. In his excitement he had
come so close to the edge of the cloud that he had
sighted a shadow. The shadow had a voice, a sudden
<i>rat-tat-tat</i> that made small round holes in his right
wing. A Zero had nearly winged them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Got to have a care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They circled about in the cloud for fully five
minutes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea about that screamer?&rdquo;
Stew asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a meteor. You can see a meteor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a rocket from a plane. The Jerries have
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; Jack said once more. &ldquo;Well, guess
we&rsquo;ll slip down for another look. Tell you what&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
zoom out of this cloud full speed. That&rsquo;ll take
the Zeros by surprise. By the time they close in we&rsquo;ll
be safe in another cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s idea was a good one. Stew had one more
good look at the task force. He corrected his report&mdash;one
less destroyer than he had thought, and one
more cargo vessel. The distance was shorter, perhaps
nearer one hundred and seventy miles. Their trick
of dashing full speed from cloud to cloud fooled the
Japs. But they would soon run out at an edge
of the cloud they had just entered, small-circle it
as they might.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Nips will corner us like rabbits in a hayfield,&rdquo;
Stew grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em try it!&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s spirits were rising. This
was their day. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come out shooting. We&rsquo;ve just
got to cut one notch in the handle of your gun before
this hour gets away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; Stew patted his gun.</p>
<p>Despite his rising courage Jack&rsquo;s knees began shaking
when, for a second time, they barely escaped a
blast of fire from a Zero.</p>
<p>At last he exclaimed, &ldquo;Shucks! This cloud is too
thin and ragged. We&rsquo;ll make another run for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another run it was, and this time two Jappies
were right after them. But to his surprise Jack found
the enemy unwilling to press home the attack. They
would make a run, then as soon as they were close
enough for a possible shot, circle away. The first
time one did this Stew gave him a short quick burst
of fire, without result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted the second time, &ldquo;I know
their game. They want me to shoot out my belts of
ammunition. Then, while I&rsquo;m reloading, they&rsquo;ll slip
in for the kill. Oh no you don&rsquo;t, Jappie!&rdquo; He withheld
his fire.</p>
<p>So interesting was the game that for the time
being they forgot both the clouds and the task force.
But not for long. Suddenly Stew exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Look! That Jap task force is smaller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack did not look, for suddenly he threw his plane
into full speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow was sneaking in too close,&rdquo; Jack
exclaimed. &ldquo;Tell you what. We&rsquo;ll take him on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Let him try another sneak, then I&rsquo;ll whirl
on him with our left wing lowered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! You&rsquo;re right! I&rsquo;ll just swing this old twinflex
gun around to the front and fire across our wing
while&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I pepper him with my two guns in the
nose. Watch now. On your toes!&rdquo; Jack warned.</p>
<p>He slackened his speed a little. The Jap pressed
in. Suddenly Jack&rsquo;s motor roared like an attacking
lion. The left wing dipped. The plane cut a half
circle. Its guns flashed in unison. The Zero faltered,
fell away to the right, began to smoke, then went
into a spin.</p>
<p>Twenty seconds later, just as three Zeros dropped
at them from above, the boys lost themselves in one
more cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chalk up one Zero!&rdquo; Stew exulted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one
up for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that reminds me. I&rsquo;ve got
to get a message off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>A few seconds later he was droning into his microphone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann to Mary! Ann to Mary! Task force split.
Two cargo vessels, three destroyers, going due east.
Remainder of force same as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better stick to this cloud for a while,&rdquo; was
Jack&rsquo;s decision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good big one, and fairly thick.
Those Zeros will be swarming round it like angry
bees, but they&rsquo;ll never find us in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, we&rsquo;ve got to find out what that
break in their task force means!&rdquo; Stew insisted.</p>
<p>Jack caught low words in his earphones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack jumped. He knew that voice. It was Ted
Armour speaking. &ldquo;In a cloud over a Jap task force.&rdquo;
Jack asked very quietly, &ldquo;Where are you, Ted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a cloud over a Jap task force,&rdquo; Ted laughed
softly. &ldquo;Picked up your message. I was quite a ways
east, so I came on out. Thought you might need
some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;ah&mdash;that&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo; Jack swallowed hard.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming out for a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;m coming too. I&rsquo;ll be seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all, but Jack felt a great uplift of spirits
as he headed for the edge of his cloud. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange
world,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Friendly enemies. War is terrible
and wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A GLORIOUS FIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Ted!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed without
thinking as he headed for that dangerous
fringe of mist. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s from my home town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;You never told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you now,&rdquo; Jack snapped. &ldquo;So keep it
quiet. It&rsquo;s our secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slid out into the clear blue sky to discover
that while the main Jap task force continued to
glide serenely on its way, the two cargo ships and
three destroyers had lost themselves in a rain squall
that reached right down to the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tough luck!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just got
to locate them and see where they&rsquo;re going. They
may be the grand prize. Very likely those cargo ships
are loaded with ammunition, and one of them is a
twenty-thousand tonner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack put his plane into a steep dive. Two thousand
feet from the sea he soon lost himself in the
top of the rain squall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>They went through the squall and were out on
the other side in no time at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are! Two ships, three destroyers!&rdquo;
Stew exulted. &ldquo;Still going due east. I&rsquo;ll get in a report,
and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short to grip his machine gun and
exclaim, &ldquo;Jack! Quick! Back into the cloud! Three
Zeros are coming down at us from 5,000 feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack dipped his right wing to circle, he
thought, &ldquo;Looks like curtains for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their plane, though a sturdy and dependable
craft with some forty-five feet of wing spread, was
far from fast. The Zeros were small, light, and fast.
They seemed to drop with the speed of sound. It
looked bad. At that instant, there came a silver flash
from just above the cloud, and a U. S. fighter leaped
at the three Zeros which were dropping straight
and fast and thus unable to change their course.</p>
<p>What followed was a beautiful thing to see. Seeming
to stand in mid-air, the U. S. fighter pilot handled
his guns as a bird hunter does his fowling piece.
He picked off the first two Zeros and sent them
flaming to the sea below&mdash;then sent the third wheeling
harmlessly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Ted!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed as he slid his
plane into the small cloud that hung above the rain
squall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;He handles his plane as though he were dancing,&rdquo;
Stew said. There was admiration in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ted for you. He
was the finest dancer in our school, or our town, for
that matter. He played basketball and tennis the
same way, with perfect rhythm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think what the war has done to the world,&rdquo;
Stew murmured. &ldquo;Sets a fellow teaching a fighter
plane to dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stew got off his message. He thought it hard that
all this radio reporting should be one-way stuff, but
of course it was necessary for the carrier to maintain
radio silence, otherwise her position might be
given away and she herself might be attacked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t the bombers come?&rdquo; Stew was growing
restless with the delay. Since their job was to
shadow the Jap task force until the dive bombers
and torpedo planes arrived, they would not be free
to leave until the others put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Commander will hold the bombers and
their fighter protection until all scouts are heard
from,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Stew was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there may be other Jap task forces lurking
about the sea waiting to send their air fleets after
the <i>Black Bee</i>. She must not be left unprotected.
She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Stew broke in. To their ears came the
sound of machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted&rsquo;s in a fight. We&rsquo;ve got to get out and help
him!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t let that swarm of
Zeros gang up on him.&rdquo; He set their plane climbing.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just get some altitude, have a look, then fly
right down onto them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good stuff!&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;We can dive with
the best of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only after they had climbed out of their
cloud on up to the one above, and out at the top of
that one, to a height of five thousand feet, that Jack
took time out for a downward glance. Then, what
he saw all but cost him the chance of a grand fight.
What&rsquo;s more, much of his life might have been
radically changed, had he failed to come to a decision
in the next sixty seconds. Almost directly beneath
them, a little to the left, an air battle raged
between four Zeros and a single-seated U. S. fighter.</p>
<p>Jack did not need to be told that the lone fighter
was the boy from his own home town, Ted. It could
be none other, for the broad, sweeping circles his
plane made appeared to be timed to the tune of a
Strauss waltz.</p>
<p>At the moment they sighted Ted he was being
followed by a Zero that spouted fire. The distance
was too great; the shots did not take effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Instead of turning on his opponent, Ted swung
up and under an enemy coming from above and,
seeming to stand his plane on its tail, sent a burst
of fire into the enemy&rsquo;s engine. The Zero wavered.
Something hung from it for a space of seconds, then
rocketed downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot off his motor!&rdquo; Jack exulted.</p>
<p>Stew did not hear. His mind was still on the task
before him. The rain squall was over. He spotted
the two groups of enemy ships, also some small
islands off to the east. With a strange sense of finality
coursing through his being, he reported all this to
the <i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i> radioman. As he listened after that,
he thought he heard the low rumble of many distant
planes. He could not be sure; too much was going
on directly beneath them.</p>
<p>Continuing his magnificent circles, Ted came up
behind the very Zero that seconds before had been
following him. He let out a burst of fire. Smoking
badly, the Zero limped into a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Now we&rsquo;ve got to get down there!&rdquo; Jack
tilted his plane for a steep dive, then set his motor
at top speed.</p>
<p>The two remaining Zeros were closing in on Ted.
At the same time three others were swinging in on
him from the left. The three were flying in formation,
rather far apart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready with your twinflex,&rdquo; Jack ordered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go right into that trio and break it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did the Japs see them coming? No matter. They
came in too fast for the Japs to dodge. At just the
right instant Jack pulled up short, then let out a
burst of fire that cut squarely across the lead plane
of the Japs.</p>
<p>At the same time Stew swung his twinflex
gun on the second plane and let him have it for all
he was worth.</p>
<p>What happened after that came so quickly that
it remained a blur in Jack&rsquo;s memory. Afterward he
seemed to recall seeing two Jap planes falling, and
Ted, with a damaged plane, disappearing into a
cloud. At the same time something had creased his
forehead. He went dizzy for an instant, then he was
all right again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got our radio!&rdquo; Stew reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t steer right!&rdquo; Jack headed her into
a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Stew sighed. &ldquo;No radio. No
more work for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack scarcely listened. He was hearing a rumble.
It came from the west. &ldquo;Bombers! Our bombers!&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our work is finished!&rdquo; Stew exulted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;All but getting back. And that we can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
There was an air of finality in Jack&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;That
Jap did plenty to this plane. Nearly got me too.
Take a look at my right temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stew leaned forward, then whistled. &ldquo;Burned you,
all right. Bleeding a little. Wait. I&rsquo;ll fix you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They circled slowly in their cloud while first aid
was applied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some islands off to the east,&rdquo; Stew
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout fifty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s our best bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Jack eased his plane over toward the
edge of the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the Zeros?&rdquo; Stew asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance we have to take,&rdquo; Jack replied
soberly. &ldquo;This old kite won&rsquo;t stay up too long. Be
prepared to give them the works if they show up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The works it shall be,&rdquo; Stew replied grimly as
he reloaded his powerful weapon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A GOOD SHOW</span></h2>
<p>The Zeros, it seemed, were engaged elsewhere.
When Jack and Stew emerged from their cloud
none were in sight, nor were the islands that Stew
had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rain squall has hidden the islands. They&rsquo;re
there, all the same,&rdquo; Stew insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance.&rdquo; In vain Jack tried to get
more power from his disabled motor. It coughed,
sputtered&mdash;all but died&mdash;then carried on.</p>
<p>Heading due east, he started to climb. He had
gained a thousand feet or more when he began losing
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look over your parachute,&rdquo; he said to Stew.
&ldquo;Be sure you can get hold of our rubber raft at a
second&rsquo;s notice. This motor may die at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all done,&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;All in order. Let&rsquo;s have
a look at your chute.&rdquo; He worked over Jack&rsquo;s chute
and harness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. Be sure to pull the cord,&rdquo;
he joked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s always a necessity, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I know,&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s voice was cheerful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad we got our job done before this thing
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea&rsquo;s fairly smooth. We&rsquo;ll get on. Some kind
of a bird will light on us. They always do&mdash;booby,
gull&mdash;something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, they light on anything that stands out
above the water.&rdquo; Jack set his ship climbing again.
They were inside the rain squall. From not too far
away came the sound of sudden battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zeros and our fighters have tangled.&rdquo; Stew became
tremendously excited. &ldquo;Boy! This is going to
be terrific! Wish we could see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like taking in a world-series game from behind
a high board fence,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;But leave it to
our bombers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sure good! They took that other carrier
we discovered a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tops, those bombers!&rdquo; Jack had a great
love for his ship and her men. &ldquo;There never was a
carrier like the <i>Black Bee</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar of bombers coming on in formation
filled the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re climbing! I can tell by the sound!&rdquo;
Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;Boy! Just you wait!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Stew all but stood up in his place while Jack
divided his attention between the bombers and his
disabled motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed at last. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re
diving! Listen!&rdquo; He held his breath, counting &ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had reached twenty when there came a roar.
&ldquo;Oh! Too bad! That one missed!&rdquo; Hardly were the
words out of his mouth when there came a second
roar. &ldquo;Right on the beam! Boy! Oh boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six bombers dumped their loads. &ldquo;Three connected,&rdquo;
was Stew&rsquo;s decision. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very good
record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden they emerged from the
screening rain squall to find themselves over a
bright, blue sea. In the center of this sea, two large
cargo ships and three destroyers steamed rapidly
toward the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Stew groaned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get away! And I
have a hunch they&rsquo;re the most important of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space of seconds Jack considered turning
back in an effort to direct some of the bombers
toward this target. &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
never make it in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s voice went husky, &ldquo;here come
three of our torpedo bombers. They got my message
after all! Boy! We&rsquo;re some use in the world, you and
I! And we&rsquo;re really going to see a show.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;A grandstand seat! No high fence this time.&rdquo;
Jack&rsquo;s voice expressed his joy.</p>
<p>At sight of the torpedo planes the two cargo ships
began zigzagging, while the destroyers darted in
close to them.</p>
<p>Like catbirds after hawks, four Zeros followed the
torpedo planes, but as yet were too far away to
count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man! Oh man!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Suppose those
Zeros come after us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come!&rdquo; Stew looked to the loading of
his gun. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be waiting for them. We can&rsquo;t run,
but we still can fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two destroyers lay between the torpedo planes
and the cargo ships. Their pom-pom guns began
throwing up shells. The boys could see them explode
in mid-air. Disregarding these, the torpedo pilots
came sailing straight in, dropping rapidly as they
approached their target.</p>
<p>Jack held his breath as one by one they passed
through shellfire. That&rsquo;s Dick, I imagine, he was
thinking. Dick, Bert and Phil. All swell boys!</p>
<p>One shell, exploding beneath the second plane,
lifted it into the air, but the plane came straight on.</p>
<p>At just the right moment, not five hundred feet
from the sea, the first plane released its &ldquo;tin fish.&rdquo;
Jack saw it hit the sea and speed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bull&rsquo;s-eye!&rdquo; he shouted. But the torpedo acted
strangely. It leaped into the air, then dove like a
playing porpoise. At last it reached the side of a
cargo ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Stew breathed.</p>
<p>But there came no sound. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed,
as he saw the torpedo speed away beyond the ship.
&ldquo;It went right under her! What a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish, for suddenly a mighty explosion
fairly tore the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;The second
torpedo took that ship right on the beam! And did
she explode! Must have been loaded with TNT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had not seen. What he did see was a tower
of black smoke and pieces of debris falling over the
sea. And he saw the second ship, attacked by the
last torpedo plane, meet the same fate.</p>
<p>All this had happened in the space of seconds,
and all the time their disabled plane was chugging
its way toward three small islands that stood out like
green stones set in a field of blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they raise chickens on those islands,&rdquo;
said Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chickens and no Japs,&rdquo; Jack agreed. At that moment
his eyes swept the sky for the Zeros. &ldquo;Gone,&rdquo;
he murmured at last. &ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve seen enough
for one day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>After that Jack was silent for a time. He was
thinking: Those ships were loaded with ammunition
intended for Japs on some island. If they had
gone through safely, hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of our Marines and Army men might have died. We
got them. A feeling of pride in a job well done, a
task in which he and Stew had played a large part,
coursed through his being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found them. The torpedo planes destroyed
them,&rdquo; he said aloud. At that moment he would not
have traded his job as a scout for any other in the
service.</p>
<p>But what of the attack on the Jap carrier and her
escort? Only sound could tell them the story, for the
rain squall still hid that battle from their sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our radio is gone,&rdquo; he said to Stew. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
headed for an unknown island. No one will know
where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Stew agreed soberly. &ldquo;Even those
three torpedo planes have gone to join the attack
on the carrier. We&rsquo;re in the sky alone.&rdquo; A strange
wave of loneliness swept over him. &ldquo;It may be
months before we know how that battle ended.&rdquo;
Jack nodded in the direction from which came a
continuous roar of motors, machine-gun fire, bursting
shells, and exploding bombs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re on our
own, and I don&rsquo;t mean maybe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PLANE WRECKED</span></h2>
<p>The plane rattled, sputtered, and roared. Stew
threw back the hood, climbed out to the wings
to see what, if anything, might be done to keep her
aloft. Then he threw back his seat to drop flat on his
stomach and poke around in the fuselage. His hand
touched Jack&rsquo;s violin. He shoved this forward within
easy reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack can play for the birds, the lizards, and the
land crabs on our island,&rdquo; he said to himself with a
grim laugh.</p>
<p>There was not much he could do. The main trouble
was with the motor. It had taken a slug or two,
and was beginning to smoke.</p>
<p>Alternately they gained and lost altitude. Each
time they lost more than they had gained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Zero!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed, righting his
seat and gripping his gun.</p>
<p>The Zero kept poking its nose in and out of the
rain squall that was moving slowly toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scouting for their lost cargo ships,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>The three destroyers, now robbed of their
charges, were beginning to slip from sight. &ldquo;Going
to that other fight,&rdquo; Jack thought. He and Stew were
leaving the fight behind, and under the circumstances
he was not sorry. It seemed less violent now.
Had their comrades won or lost? Had the Jap carrier
been put out of action? He did not know the
answer.</p>
<p>His motor coughed hoarsely, then was silent.
They lost altitude rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready to bail out!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>The motor coughed, rumbled, then thundered
afresh.</p>
<p>They climbed once more, then slowly sank.</p>
<p>The islands were much closer now. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better
head for the middle one,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the largest.
Got quite a peak in the middle of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be several hundred feet high,&rdquo; Stew said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s sure to be good, fresh water there. Natives
too. There&rsquo;s an island around here somewhere,
they say, where the natives eat shipwrecked Chinamen,
or used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not Chinamen!&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s laugh was a
bit doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be they&rsquo;re not choosy.&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s laugh was
doubtful too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to take a chance, that&rsquo;s all war is after all&mdash;just
one risk after another. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor went dead again. One more struggle,
one more victory.</p>
<p>Twice more this was repeated. The last time they
were not much more than ten miles from the islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all she&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; Jack decided. &ldquo;Get ready
to tumble out if we land too hard. We&rsquo;re going
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping the half-inflated lifeboat, Stew shoved
back the hood, and stood there, with the wind in
his eyes, as they circled downward.</p>
<p>The time was surprisingly short. They hit the
water hard, bounced, struck again&mdash;then with a
final splash, the plane almost nosed over into the sea.</p>
<p>Stew had the life raft ready in a twinkling&mdash;none
too soon at that, for their left wing was all but torn
away.</p>
<p>Stew was on the life raft, with paddle in hand.
Jack was prepared to drop down onto the raft when
he stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a second,&rdquo; he said, climbing into the plane
again.</p>
<p>He came back after a while with the violin. &ldquo;After
what Ted did for us today,&rdquo; he confided, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
leave it.&rdquo; And they paddled away toward the
middle island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;That Ted must be a real guy,&rdquo; was Stew&rsquo;s
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the half of it. I&rsquo;ll tell you about
it some time.&rdquo; Jack settled back against the circular
side of the raft. &ldquo;Boy! Am I tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Stew advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to paddle ten miles at least. A Jap
plane may spot us on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really need to paddle at all,&rdquo; Stew said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strong current running toward the
islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Jack sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you went back for the violin I threw a
stick into the water. It started right for the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;was my whittling stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; Stew said. &ldquo;But then, there must be
a million sticks on our island. Seems to be covered
with trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The current was not all that Stew had hoped for.
It carried them along at no more than two miles an
hour. And the distance was far greater than they had
imagined. For several hours they were obliged to
paddle beneath hot, tropical skies. Finally, when the
sun had gone to rest and the moon had taken up its
watch, they found themselves listening to the easy
wash of the surf against the mysterious shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>As they came close it seemed that the island&rsquo;s one
mountain leaned over like a vast giant for a look
at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be just our luck to land close to a native village.&rdquo;
Stew shuddered as they neared the shadowy shores.
The moon still was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might have chickens,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be content with emergency rations,&rdquo; Stew
decided.</p>
<p>Once Stew imagined that he caught a glimpse of
a flicker of light along the shore. &ldquo;Cannibals,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be worse.&rdquo; Jack fingered his automatic.
&ldquo;Could be Japs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, a long, sweeping wave picked up their
small raft with startling suddenness and they found
themselves on a gravel beach. Before the next wave
arrived they had dragged the raft to safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s service!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s have
a look.&rdquo; He snapped on a small flashlight.</p>
<p>They discovered the beach to be very narrow.
Back of it were tumbled piles of massive rocks, and
behind these, a solid, stone wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Stew pointed to tangled masses of logs,
seaweed, and broken palms that lay on the rocks far
above their heads. &ldquo;Some storm to do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and another storm may do the same to us.
We&rsquo;d better ramble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>To the right the beach ended abruptly in a stone
wall, but to the left it broadened. Tramping over
the rocks for a quarter of a mile, they came at last
to a spot where the land sloped away, offering
enough soil to support coconut palms and other
tropical trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; Jack decided.</p>
<p>Climbing up the slope, Stew gathered ripe coconuts
from the ground. After striking off the husks,
he bored holes through the eyes with his sheath
knife and drank the milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had drained four coconuts dry, they
turned their attention to other matters.</p>
<p>They broke open their rations and ate sparingly.
They cracked a coconut and ate its meat. Then they
stretched out side by side on the rubber raft, pillowed
their heads against the round outside, drew a
mosquito-bar canopy over themselves, and lay there
looking at the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were on the shore of Lake Superior,&rdquo; Jack
sighed, &ldquo;I could like this for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great&rsquo;s the word, all right!&rdquo; Jack became enthusiastic.
&ldquo;We used to have a regular gang, half a
dozen fellows and more girls. Campfire parties, canoeing
in the moonlight, sings&mdash;all that....&rdquo; His
voice trailed off. Then, &ldquo;Patsy was up there once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Patsy?&rdquo; Stew asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a girl I used to know. We grew up together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh-huh,&rdquo; Stew drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted took her away from me at last, or at least I
think he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Ted?&rdquo; Stew sat up. &ldquo;The one who came out
today to help us fight the Japs? The Ted who saved
our lives? Hm-m-m! Sounds a little bit queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we practically saved his life too. That
might also seem strange. It&rsquo;s that way in war. War
changes a lot of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Jack said, sitting up, &ldquo;Ted and I were
rivals. He was what the girls call &lsquo;smooth&rsquo;. I wasn&rsquo;t.
You know how I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He beat me in some things, and I beat him in
others. Then he went after Patsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t smooth?&rdquo; Stew drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how come you&rsquo;re pals now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not really, you see. Ted and I both joined
the Navy air force. We went to different training
bases. I never saw him again until we met on board
the <i>Black Bee</i>. Then he dragged me off to one side
and said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s voice was tense. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that
screaming again! It&rsquo;s coming this way like the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack listened with all his might. How weird it
was, that screech coming in out of the silence of the
night. &ldquo;Some witch riding a broomstick.&rdquo; He
laughed uncertainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some Jap trick,&rdquo; Stew muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; Jack said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a brand new notion about that thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes one want to be in an air-raid shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t. We haven&rsquo;t even got a cave.
But there&rsquo;s no need really. It&rsquo;s got the whole island
to strike, and it must be five miles long. The law
of averages gives us one chance in a million of being
hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Stew settled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That law of averages is mighty comforting sometimes,&rdquo;
Jack went on. &ldquo;Take this war. We&rsquo;ve eleven
million men in uniform. How many do you think
will get killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half that many, I&rsquo;ll bet. That gives you and
me one chance out of twenty-two of getting home
alive. But maybe only a quarter of a million will be
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forget that, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Stew begged. &ldquo;Death
and that infernal howl don&rsquo;t go so hot together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the screech filled the air.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden it dropped to become a mere
whisper. &ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s funny!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say!&rdquo; Stew drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>The voice of the unknown rose again, but this
time the sound rose and fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like the sound of a plane circling for
a landing,&rdquo; Jack told himself.</p>
<p>Then suddenly there was no sound at all. And
though he wasn&rsquo;t sure, Jack thought he caught a
glimpse of a dark shadow darting low over the water
some distance away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A NIGHT&rsquo;S ADVENTURES</span></h2>
<p>For a full three minutes after the sound had
ceased abruptly, the two boys sat in absolute
silence. Stew was waiting for the sound of a violent
explosion. More minutes ticked away, and still silence
over their tropical isle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; Stew sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the only ones on this island,&rdquo; Jack
said in a husky whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What makes you think that?&rdquo; Stew was
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thing is not a torpedo,&rdquo; Jack said, speaking
slowly. &ldquo;Nothing of the sort. It&rsquo;s an airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such a sound!&rdquo; Stew protested. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
hear the propeller or the motors either. Whoever
heard of a plane that made a noise like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s tone was thoughtful. &ldquo;Perhaps
a lot of people heard of it. We don&rsquo;t know
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What people? Japs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But I doubt that. Japs are clever imitators,
but they don&rsquo;t invent things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Then it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Stew breathed. &ldquo;If
they&rsquo;re white men they&rsquo;re friendly to us. Perhaps
they&rsquo;ll take us off this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be too sure of that.&rdquo; Jack pricked
Stew&rsquo;s bubble of hope. &ldquo;They might be Nazis. Don&rsquo;t
forget that there were a lot of Germans in these
islands before the war&mdash;promoters, prospectors,
traders, spies&mdash;all sorts. Now that Japan has the
Malay Peninsula and the Dutch East Indies, do you
think the Germans are staying away? Not on your
life! They&rsquo;re right in there getting theirs. You often
hear of a German blockade runner being caught
trying to sneak into Germany with badly needed
raw materials. Where did the cargo come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right over there,&rdquo; Stew pointed to the west.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet your sweet life we have! We&rsquo;ll take
turns keeping watch tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly will,&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;All the same,
before I leave this island I&rsquo;m going to have a look
at that squealer if it costs me a leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">At that same moment back on the carrier, in the
Commander&rsquo;s cabin, Ted Armour was saying to the
Commander:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think, sir, that something should be done
about those two boys, Jack and Stew. They did a
magnificent job, sir, watching that Jap task force
up to the minute our bombers arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; the Commander agreed. &ldquo;I shall
recommend that they be given a citation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not what I mean, sir.&rdquo; Ted was in
dead earnest. &ldquo;Their plane was damaged, but they
were not on fire when I last saw them. They
couldn&rsquo;t have had a bad crackup. My theory is that
they made a try for those islands off to the east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope they made it.&rdquo; The Commander was
pleased; for after all, he liked Jack very much and
admired the courage the young Ensign had displayed
that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, all the islands in this region are held
by the Japs, are they not?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all of them. But they are not all occupied
by Japs. The smaller, rougher islands have been
passed up by them as of little or no consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are natives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild natives, cannibals&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that. There have been
missionaries.&rdquo; The Commander tapped his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we should make a search for
them, sir?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;A search at night is impractical. Tomorrow,&rdquo; the
Commander&rsquo;s voice dropped, &ldquo;we hope to be two
hundred miles from here, bent on a dangerous
mission. This Jap task force we encountered today
was in the nature of an accident, a fortunate accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then nothing will be done, sir,&rdquo; Ted&rsquo;s voice fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. In a few days we should
be passing this way again. Then we&rsquo;ll look them up,
if such a thing is possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed. &ldquo;A lot can happen
in a few days, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, my son. But this is war. In war we
must all face the consequences.&rdquo; The Commander
rose. &ldquo;I appreciate your interest in your friends.
You, yourself did splendid work today. It shall not
be forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; Ted waved a hand. &ldquo;Add it to Jack&rsquo;s
share of glory, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Navy,&rdquo; the Commander smiled, &ldquo;there
can be no reflected glory. Don&rsquo;t be too greatly disturbed
by the plight of your comrades,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably eating native-fried chicken at
this very moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping.&rdquo; Ted smiled uncertainly. &ldquo;Many
thanks, sir. Good night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; The interview was at an end, but
for Ted the incident was not closed, nor would it
be until Jack and Stew were safely back on the carrier,
or known to be gone forever.</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime, sitting there beneath their
mosquito-bar canopy on the dark mysterious island,
Jack was finishing the story he had been telling to
Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer thing is,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;though you
might not say it was so queer, either; but when Ted
found me on the carrier he dragged me off to a
dark corner. He seemed pretty excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he said was, &lsquo;Look here, Jack. We&rsquo;re not
from the same town&mdash;not any more, we aren&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like that kind of talk. &lsquo;How come?&rsquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look, Jack, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.&rsquo; He seemed
very much in earnest. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything I can for you,
just anything. But you know how we&rsquo;ve always
been?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. Fighting.&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, not fighting,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but rivals. That
was all right back there,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;But here
it&rsquo;s different. Here we&rsquo;re working for Uncle Sam.
We&rsquo;ve no time now for personal rivalries. It&rsquo;s a
mighty serious business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It sure is, Ted,&rsquo; I told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right then, look.&rsquo; He grabbed my hand.
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got just one rival in this business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tojo,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;re dead right. And look,&rsquo; he gripped my
hand, &lsquo;we can&rsquo;t fight Tojo and one another at the
same time, so what do you say we don&rsquo;t tell anybody
we&rsquo;re both from Pineville?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s okay with me,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;The telling part,
I mean. But anyway we&rsquo;re from the same old town,
all the same, and that&rsquo;s the next thing to coming
from the same family, so if I ever see two fellows
in trouble, and one&rsquo;s you, I&rsquo;m going to help you
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Same here.&rsquo; He pumped my hand up and
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it, Stew?&rdquo; Jack asked
after a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikes me you&rsquo;re two grand guys,&rdquo; said Stew.
&ldquo;But what about that girl Patsy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter so much any more, I guess.&rdquo;
Jack paused. &ldquo;Of course the home folks mean a lot
to a fellow when he&rsquo;s out here. Patsy writes to me,
quite a lot, just the home town news. Wants to
know what I&rsquo;m doing, and tells me what she&rsquo;s doing.
Half a dozen other girls do the same. It&rsquo;s their
patriotic duty. Mighty nice of them, but it&rsquo;s just
their homework, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure!&rdquo; Stew was in dead earnest.
&ldquo;You just keep on writing to Patsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure I will!&rdquo; Jack laughed. &ldquo;And all the
rest of them. But it may be a long time between
letters just now. Lie down and rest,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you when I feel like changing places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait too long.&rdquo; Stew stood up and yawned.</p>
<p>After a short walk up and down the pebbly beach
Stew stretched out for a few winks of sleep. Jack
gripped his automatic and patrolled the beach.</p>
<p>As he walked he thought of all the circumstances
that had brought him to this wild spot. He had always
wanted to fly. Flying toy airplanes had been
his favorite occupation in grade-school days. The
strange, gypsylike life his family had lived in summer,
camping in some Indian cabin or roughing it
on an island, with canoes, rowboats and sailboats
always at hand, had prepared him for all this. After
high school he had spent a winter on an island as
assistant ranger. His only contact with the outside
world had been by radio. For five months no boat
came to the ice-locked island. Snowshoes, long inspection
marches, nights in deserted cabins, wolves,
moose, and snow buntings. He had loved it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we haven&rsquo;t even a radio,&rdquo; he thought. It
was strange how the jigsaw puzzle of his life appeared
to fit together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have always had my violin,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;And
I still have one,&rdquo; he reminded himself, with a start.</p>
<p>When midnight came and went with no sign of
life on the island, he at last took the violin from
its case and began playing &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ave Maria.&rdquo; How strange it sounded there in
the silent night.</p>
<p>He played on. For a full hour he was lost to his
surroundings. The simple things he had played as a
small boy came back to him. So, too, did the more
difficult selections he had played with the college
orchestra in his home town, and the one that had
won first place for him in the state high-school contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all in the past,&rdquo; he thought once. But he
wasn&rsquo;t sure. He sat on a fallen palm tree, with
the violin across his knee, and dreamed of a great
concert orchestra and of a funny little conductor
with a shock of white hair&mdash;a very fine musician.
And in that dream he saw himself playing as the
soloist of the performance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Then he took up his violin and played again.
Though his strings were muted, the low melodies
carried far in the still night. It was during the playing
of his last piece that two figures appeared on
the ledge far above him. Standing there in the
moonlight, their light garments turned them into
ghosts. Realizing this, perhaps, they moved back
into the shadow of a great rock, but still they lingered.
All unconscious of this, Jack played on. Then
suddenly he was wakened from his dream by a wild
shout from Stew, a cry of pain and fright.</p>
<p>The two figures on the rocks darted away so
quickly that they loosened a stone which went tumbling
down to stop with a crash a short distance
from the spot where Jack sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stew! What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a Jap!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;He tried to
carve me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Jap!&rdquo; Jack laughed as he came dashing up.
&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any Jap. Couldn&rsquo;t have been. I
would have seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look! My ear is bleeding!&rdquo; Stew rubbed
his ear.</p>
<p>After a hasty glance up the rocky ridge Jack
turned on his flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your Jap,&rdquo; he laughed. He pointed to a
huge land crab with pincers six inches long. &ldquo;He
was looking for something soft.&rdquo; Jack seized the crab
by its back and tossed it far up on the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; Jack snapped off the light.
&ldquo;There was something up there on that ridge, and
it wasn&rsquo;t a crab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? How do you know?&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;A rock came tumbling down. Thought I caught
a flash of something white. I might have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to watch our step.&rdquo; Stew spoke in a
solemn tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure must,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>But something more than the thought of danger
was troubling Jack at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t get off this island in a day or two,&rdquo;
he said gloomily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re almost sure to miss the Big
Show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Stew breathed. &ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d about as soon be dead as to miss that.&rdquo;
Jack&rsquo;s gloom deepened. Occasionally during his
watch, when he listened in vain for the sound of
a rescue plane, the thought of the &ldquo;Big Show&rdquo; and
the part he wanted to play in it became a definite
goal.</p>
<p>Only the night before, the ship&rsquo;s commander had
said to him, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a little job to do down
south of here. Then, I hope, we&rsquo;re due to join the
big push for the grandest show of all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Yes! The &ldquo;Big Show&rdquo;! Whispers had gone around
the ship. For two whole weeks rumors had been
crystallizing into facts. They would join other task
forces, a dozen carriers, some big battle wagons, a
hundred&mdash;perhaps two hundred&mdash;fighting ships,
scores of transports and cargo ships, as well as many
fast PT boats. Then all together, with the greatest
fighting force the world had ever known, they would
go after Mindanao.</p>
<p>And what was Mindanao? For the fiftieth time
Jack got out a map, and flashing his pinpoint light
on a spot said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is, one of the largest of the Philippine
Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacArthur said he&rsquo;d go back, and now we&rsquo;re
going,&rdquo; Stew said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; Jack demanded bitterly.
&ldquo;Looks as if we&rsquo;re stuck right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there if I have to swim!&rdquo; Stew vowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Suppose you sit up for a while and
think that one over,&rdquo; Jack suggested, &ldquo;while I grab
three winks of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A LOOK AT A MYSTERY PLANE</span></h2>
<p>Jack awoke with a start. The hot tropical sun
shone on his face. Despite the threat of danger,
he had slept soundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; He sat up suddenly to find Stew laughing
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dream of yours must have been a humdinger!&rdquo;
Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;You were grinning from
ear to ear in your sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a dream,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;I was back on
my uncle&rsquo;s farm. It was morning. Birds were singing,
and a rooster crowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He still is.&rdquo; Stew chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who still is what?&rdquo; Jack stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rooster&rsquo;s still crowing. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack listened, and sure enough, there came the
lusty crow of a rooster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People!&rdquo; Jack stood up. &ldquo;Our island has inhabitants!
Where there&rsquo;s chickens there&rsquo;s folks! What
do you know about that? Shall we look them up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; said Stew in a puzzled tone.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure there are people on these islands.
Those chickens may be wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;But that fellow
who flies the howling plane must be human, so
we&rsquo;d better watch our step, since that means there&rsquo;s
someone on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant native people,&rdquo; Stew corrected. &ldquo;Many
of these small islands are deserted now. The natives
went to larger islands, or the Japs have taken them
off. Perhaps it&rsquo;s true here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but if we don&rsquo;t look up
the natives or whoever is on this place, how&rsquo;ll we
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s emergency rations for us,&rdquo; Stew replied.
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not so bad. We&rsquo;ve got matches for
a fire and there&rsquo;s powdered coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee! Boy! Lead me to it!&rdquo; Jack jumped up.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll make a small fire and get the coffee ready,
I&rsquo;ll look around a little and see what our possibilities
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to have a look at that screamer
today or know the reason why!&rdquo; Stew told himself
as he collected dried shreds of palm fronds, coconut
shucks, and splinters of wood for a fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The crowing rooster had become mysteriously silent.
Convinced by this fact that he must be wild,
Jack climbed over boulders and forced his way
through briar patches to reach at last the crest of
the ridge.</p>
<p>Not wishing to expose himself to so broad a view,
he threw himself down on a broad rock, then
dragged himself forward for a view of the land that
lay beyond. He let out a gasp of surprise.</p>
<p>Beneath him was a lower ridge, and on outcropping
rocks, with their backs to him, gazing off at
the sea, were two native girls. He knew too little
about native girls to judge their ages, but both
seemed fully grown. They wore short, loose dresses
of bright-colored cotton.</p>
<p>The two girls were so strangely different that it
seemed they could hardly belong to the same tribe.
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; the boy reasoned, &ldquo;they must.&rdquo; Both
were quite dark, but there the similarity ended. One
was short and stocky, with a mop of black hair that
stood out all around her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular fuzzy-wuzzy,&rdquo; Jack told himself.</p>
<p>The other girl was rather slender, and her hair,
though black and curly, had a tendency to lie down.</p>
<p>The short stout one held a live chicken by its
feet. &ldquo;There goes our rooster,&rdquo; Jack thought.</p>
<p>The tall girl had a bunch of small wild bananas
slung over her shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;they may have left a
bunch of bananas still on the stalk near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the tall, slender girl, turned halfway
around. Startled, not wishing to be seen, Jack drew
back.</p>
<p>When he looked again the two girls were walking
along the rocks. He got a profile view of them.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;they are very different.&rdquo; Both
were barefoot, but the tall one walked with a joyous
spring, while the other one just plodded along.
With a laugh the tall girl lifted the bunch of bananas
to her head, then, with this crown, she moved
away as regally as a queen.</p>
<p>When they had vanished into the bushes he slid
back down the rock to his own side of the ridge.
After following the ridge for a short distance he
took a different route toward their beach.</p>
<p>To his great joy, half way there he came upon
a cluster of banana plants growing in a narrow run.</p>
<p>A small stream went trickling and tumbling down
the center of the run. Taking a collapsible drinking
cup from his pocket, he bent over a pool to fill the
cup, then started in surprise. In the soft sand by
the pool was the fresh imprint of a bare foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been on our side of the ridge,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Half way down the slope. I wonder if
they saw us?&rdquo; This discovery disturbed him. One
never could tell about natives in these wild islands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>The water was fresh and cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umm! Cold spring!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Water
supply.&rdquo; He made a mental note&mdash;he must follow
that stream back to its source.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the banana patch, he discovered
more evidence of their visitors, if they might
be called that. One banana plant was minus a
freshly cut bunch of bananas.</p>
<p>Selecting a fine bunch that was still green, he
cut it off with a sheath knife, shouldered it, and
went back down the ridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not alone here,&rdquo; he said, when he reached
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo; Stew asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives beat us here. I saw two of them. They
had our rooster. But I got some bananas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;How come you picked green
ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be all right when they ripen,&rdquo; Jack explained.
&ldquo;When they ripen on the plant, bananas
are not fit to eat. They lose their flavor and become
tasteless; also the skin bursts open and the ripening
pulp is attacked by insects. We&rsquo;ll hang this bunch
up to ripen in the shade, and eat them as they
ripen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drank coffee and nibbled at the chocolate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were those natives armed?&rdquo; Stew asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure!&rdquo; Jack smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spears or clubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knives,&rdquo; said Jack. He might have added, &ldquo;and
smiles,&rdquo; but did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do about the natives?&rdquo; Stew asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. At least, not till night. You can&rsquo;t tell
about natives. They must live in a village or a
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. We&rsquo;ll have to find out where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slip around at night and have a look at
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll know better what we&rsquo;re up against.
That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;But when it
comes to seeing that screamer, I&rsquo;m in favor of having
a long-distance look in the daytime. If it&rsquo;s a
plane, and they&rsquo;re Japs or Germans, we&rsquo;ve got to
see what can be done about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wander up along this side of the ridge
after a while,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;That plane, or whatever
it is, must be on this side. I think the native
village is on the other side. We&rsquo;ll try to dodge the
natives for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Eager to explore the island and solve its mysteries,
they were soon working their way along the
sloping side of the ridge. Almost at once they came
upon a hard-beaten trail that ran along the smoothest
portion of the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Native trail,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound too good to me,&rdquo; said Stew.
&ldquo;We may meet some of those big boys with long
spears. They have a playful way of fastening flying
squirrels&rsquo; teeth to the point of a spear, for barbs.
If you do get the spear out, the teeth stay in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jack stopped suddenly to examine a
soft spot in the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoof prints!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;But shucks!
They&rsquo;re small. Those animals can&rsquo;t be very dangerous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Jack laughed. &ldquo;Little wild boars
with long noses and curved ivory tusks. Let me tell
you, a palm tree makes pretty tough climbing, but
if you ever hear one of those little porkers grunting
behind you, you&rsquo;ll climb one easy enough. We don&rsquo;t
dare fire a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, their fears proved groundless. They
walked the length of the slope, some three miles,
and came at last to a place where the island sloped
away in a series of treeless ledges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>On the last ledge, which sloped very gradually
into the sea, there was something resembling a plane.
Two men were moving about it. Since they were
still half a mile away, they could make out very few
details of this strange setup.</p>
<p>Pulling his companion into the shadow of a
rock, Jack unslung his small binoculars for a look.
Instantly his lips parted in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That plane has no propeller!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably took it off for repairs,&rdquo; Stew suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Jack was clearly puzzled. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t look quite like any plane I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the men like?&rdquo; Stew asked. &ldquo;Give me
a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he grunted, when he held the binoculars
to his eyes. &ldquo;White men&mdash;not Japs. Not in uniform.
Might be anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably German traders who stayed here,&rdquo;
Jack suggested. &ldquo;These islands were full of them
before the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;m for getting off this island mighty
quick!&rdquo; Stew declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives might help us. But say! What&rsquo;s going
on?&rdquo; Steve&rsquo;s voice rose. Jack hushed him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Stew insisted in a whisper, handing back
the binoculars. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gassing her up! Aren&rsquo;t
those kerosene barrels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure are,&rdquo; Jack agreed, after a look. &ldquo;But you
could put gas in them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Fascinated, the boys watched until the strangers
had finished fueling the plane and had rolled the
barrels into a crevasse, where they covered them
with driftwood and dry palm fronds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty secretive,&rdquo; Stew whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are all the islanders these days. This is war.
We&mdash;look!&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s whisper was shrill. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
climbed in to take off and they haven&rsquo;t any propeller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good joke on them!&rdquo; Stew chuckled. &ldquo;They
won&rsquo;t get far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plane was facing the sea. When the brakes
were released, it slid slowly down the slope into
the water. Ten seconds later the plane let out a low
squeal, then started gliding over the blue sea. The
squeal rose to a howl. Faster and faster went the
propellerless thing until at last it left the water
to sail away at tremendous speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that!&rdquo; Jack stood
staring until the plane was a mere speck in the sky.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I won&rsquo;t believe&mdash;a plane without
a propeller that squeals and howls and goes
faster than any plane you or I ever saw. Come on!
Let&rsquo;s go down there for a better look at those fuel
drums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there might be more men.&rdquo; Stew hung back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! If there were others they wouldn&rsquo;t
have hidden the drums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Stew followed Jack.</p>
<p>Once they were at the spot the plane had just
left, they were convinced at once that the mystery
plane actually burned kerosene, for the air was filled
with kerosene fumes and the buckets and barrels
smelled of it. &ldquo;Kerosene, beyond a doubt,&rdquo; Jack exclaimed.
&ldquo;Think of doing four or five hundred
miles per hour on kerosene!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! Let&rsquo;s get out of here! They may come
back.&rdquo; He led the way rapidly up the slope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TAGGED MONKEY</span></h2>
<p>There was little room to doubt that the trail
they had followed was used by natives as well
as by animals, for on their way back they came
upon fresh prints of bare feet in the soft earth.</p>
<p>Stew had uncomfortable visions of poisoned arrows
and darts from blowguns flying at them
through the brush, but Jack, gripping his automatic,
marched straight ahead.</p>
<p>Arriving at the spot where the narrow stream
tumbled down, they decided to follow it to its
source. In just a moment they found themselves
confronted with a problem. They had come to a
thicket of thorny bushes. These formed an arch
over the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one thing to do&mdash;pull off our shoes and
wade it,&rdquo; Jack decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go native.&rdquo; Stew laughed as he kicked off his
G.I. brogans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Cold!&rdquo; he exclaimed as he plunged his
feet into the water. But on they went. Tumbling
down a steep slope the stream formed many pools,
some fairly large. As he waded through one of
these up to his knees, Jack exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are fish in this pool! I feel them tickling
my toes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Stew was an ardent, though usually an
unlucky, fisherman. &ldquo;Got a line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure have!&rdquo; Jack pulled a hook and line from
his pocket. &ldquo;I took it from the rubber raft. They
all carry them now, just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you brought one along, just in case,&rdquo; Stew
laughed. &ldquo;Wait till we&rsquo;re out in the clear and we&rsquo;ll
hook our dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Jack paused to listen. From up stream
there came the sound of splashing water, then of
rocks rolling down, and after that a hoarse grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild pigs!&rdquo; Stew whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably doing a little fishing on their own,&rdquo;
Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Wouldn&rsquo;t a young porker taste good
roasted over the coals! And here they don&rsquo;t take ration
points!&rdquo; Stew laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they do take shots,&rdquo; Jack protested. &ldquo;And
shots are out. We&rsquo;re not going to bring those natives
down on us, not before we&rsquo;ve had a good look
at them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Oh boy! Are we in a pickle!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.
&ldquo;If some old boar comes down this stream
looking for trouble he&rsquo;ll force us into a fight. If
we shoot and miss, he&rsquo;ll tear us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; Jack decided after a moment&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep going as long as we can.
Then we&rsquo;ll work our way back up the bank into
the bush and let that drove of porkers pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as we can&rdquo; was only another ten yards,
for suddenly the old guardian of the drove caught
their scent and came charging down upon them.</p>
<p>By a mighty struggle they forced their way back
into the brush just before the ugly beast with chop-chopping
jaws and gleaming tusks came charging
past.</p>
<p>The lesser fry, about a half dozen of them, had
just stampeded past, when the old boar turned and
came charging back upstream. This time he made
no mistake. His beady eyes were upon Stew.</p>
<p>As he lowered his ugly head preparing for a
charge, Stew drew his automatic, but Jack, swinging
a knife that was a cross between a sheath knife
and a machete, struck the angry beast a cutting
blow across his ugly snout.</p>
<p>With a loud squeal and an angry grunt, the mad
creature came on. Jack let him have it again, neatly
carving out a curled ivory tusk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Before he could swing again the pig reared,
gnashed its teeth, then tumbled back into the
stream, to go rushing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! But that was close!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed, when
after a short wait they resumed their journey upstream.</p>
<p>At the top of the brush canopy, to their surprise
they came upon a tiny lake. All rimmed round with
gray rocks, it was blue as the sky above, and in its
clear water many tropical fish were moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Any rich man in America would give a
fortune to have this in his back yard!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, sure,&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;But a fish is a fish
and I&rsquo;m having some broiled for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the line.&rdquo; Jack held it out to him. &ldquo;Try
your luck. I&rsquo;m going up higher to find the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few yards farther up, the stream forked, and
at the head of the first fork he sought and found
a cool, bubbling spring. And beside that spring
was the telltale mark of a human foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a big village of natives,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Sooner or later, we&rsquo;ll have to cast our lot
with them, but I&rsquo;m bound I&rsquo;ll have a look at them
first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Jack filled his canteen and stood for a time staring
off at the sea. Once he imagined that he caught
the scream of that mysterious, propellerless plane,
but in the end he decided that it was a wild parrot&rsquo;s
call.</p>
<p>At last his gaze was fixed on one spot. Raising
his binoculars he took a good look.</p>
<p>Something out there on the sea, all right! he
assured himself. Pretty far out. Looks like a raft
or a partially submerged plane. It&rsquo;s sure to drift
this way. Current and wind are both right. If it
were only a plane we could put in working order.</p>
<p>When he returned to the small lake, he found
Stew the proud possessor of a fine string of fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grubs,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I got grubs out of a
rotten log and used them for bait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We have enough fish for
this time. In this climate they won&rsquo;t keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more,&rdquo; Stew begged as he cast in his
line. He had the fish at once, so with a sigh he gathered
up his catch, strung on a crotched stick. Then
they were off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that burns me up,&rdquo; said Jack, as they
made their way down the slope, &ldquo;is that the old
<i>Black Bee</i> may at this very moment be ganging
up with a lot of other fighting ships for a whack
at Mindanao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she is,&rdquo; Stew groaned, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll miss the biggest
show of the whole war.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;Biggest and best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Remember Pearl Harbor,&rsquo;&rdquo; Stew quoted. &ldquo;How
can we forget? We&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to get off this island&mdash;even
if we have to borrow that propellerless plane
or walk right in on the natives and say, &lsquo;Here! Give
us a lift in your canoes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make haste slowly,&rdquo; Jack replied
thoughtfully. &ldquo;We probably couldn&rsquo;t fly that plane
if those fellows gave it to us as a present. Imagine
a plane that flies without a propeller!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you saw it, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure did, on the outside. Sometime I&rsquo;ll see
the inside of it, too. You watch my smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch.&rdquo; Jack laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may not come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me they will. There&rsquo;s still
enough kerosene hidden away in that giant crevasse
to take them round the world. Looks like their
base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the boys tramped on in silence.</p>
<p>The fish, broiled over a fire of coals, were delicious.
When they had devoured the whole string,
Stew thought of dessert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about a banana?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t had time to ripen yet,&rdquo; replied
Jack. Stew sprang to his feet, took one look at the
tree from which the bananas hung, then exclaimed
in a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers! Look who&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On top of the bunch, holding a banana, sat a
small monkey with a dried-up manlike face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Jack whispered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a surprise!&rdquo;
Creeping up very softly, he suddenly popped
up within five feet of the monkey.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the monkey did not appear to be
the least bit startled. Looking Jack in the eye, he
stared at him solemnly for a space of seconds, then
with both tiny hands gripping it, he held out the
banana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s pet!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is!&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;And look! There&rsquo;s
a silver chain around his neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, monk!&rdquo; Going closer, he patted his shoulder,
and said in a quiet voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump, boy, jump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the monkey jumped. A moment later the
little monkey was nestled in Jack&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you know about this?&rdquo; Jack
echoed. &ldquo;This chain on his neck is tagged. Why,
it&rsquo;s the identification disk of an Army nurse. What
do you suppose that means?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might mean almost anything,&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;Perhaps
she came ashore here, shipwrecked, or something,
and the natives ate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, in my estimation, is out,&rdquo; Jack said, stroking
the monkey&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that were true, this monkey must have belonged
to the natives. The theory would be that
they saved the tag and put it round the monkey&rsquo;s
neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this. Monkeys are very particular about the
company they keep. If this one belonged to the
natives he&rsquo;d never make friends with a couple of
plane-wrecked white men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, he belonged to the nurse. The
monkey escaped, but the nurse was eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;It
will be dark in a short time,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just
wander over for a look at the natives. Then perhaps
we&rsquo;ll know what to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And perhaps we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Stew laughed softly.
&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s worth trying.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;HIST THERE! YOU!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Two hours later, peering from a thicket of tall
ferns and sprouting palms, the two boys were
witnessing one of the most fascinating moving pictures
from real life that they had ever chanced
upon. About a broad fire of coals was a group of
thirty or forty natives. Some were seated on palm
logs, and some were standing. All were talking and
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-m-m! Lead me to it!&rdquo; Stew whispered.</p>
<p>The object of his desire hung dripping over the
glowing coals. A small porker, bound to an iron
rod that slowly turned him over and over, had
reached a shade of delicious, golden brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And barbecued pork is the thing I am fondest
of.&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s whisper betrayed real agony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll barbecue one some time,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s only
reply. He had been studying the group intently.
They were a motley throng. There were big, dark-skinned
men in the group who could have placed
him across a knee and broken his back. There were
dark-eyed, laughing children that anyone could love.</p>
<p>The men, for the most part, wore cotton trousers.
Some of the women wore dresses, some only cotton
skirts, and some were in native grass skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that tall, slim one turning the roast,&rdquo;
Jack whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tall, slim one?&rdquo; Stew replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I didn&rsquo;t tell you!&rdquo; Jack laughed softly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would!&rdquo; Stew mocked.</p>
<p>Over near one corner of the fire two dusky maidens
were baking some sort of cakes and stacking
them in appetizing piles. The roasting of the porker
appeared to have been left to the tall, slim girl.
She turned and twisted it, prodded it with a huge
fork, then turned it again. At last, taking up a
large knife, she cut off a slice, held it up, and blew
on it to cool it.</p>
<p>At once from the throng rose an expectant murmur.
Stew joined in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, Stew!&rdquo; Jack warned in a whisper.</p>
<p>Without really knowing why, Jack had brought
the monkey on his shoulder. Now the little fellow
stirred uneasily.</p>
<p>The girl at last handed the slice of bronzed pork
to an old man with a long, wrinkled face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Carving off a small portion, he put it in his
mouth. For a space of seconds his face was a study.
Then it was lighted by a wide grin. He said a single
word. At that the crowd exploded with joyous anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done. The porker is roasted. And we don&rsquo;t
get even a bite,&rdquo; Stew groaned. &ldquo;What a life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened. The crowd
lapsed into silence. Only the snapping of bursting
coals could be heard as the natives bowed their
heads while the girl said a few words in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grace before meat,&rdquo; Stew whispered. &ldquo;What
more can you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The Nazis and the
Japs also pray. Then they go out to massacre
women, children, and helpless prisoners of war.
We&rsquo;ll wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if this scene awakened memories in his small
brain, the monkey on Jack&rsquo;s shoulder stirred, danced
for a second, then gave an immense leap that landed
him almost in the center of the throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got to beat it! They&rsquo;ll be looking
for us! Let&rsquo;s scram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a disconsolate Stew who trudged along
the native trail toward their camp. &ldquo;Lot we gained
by that!&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Just a look at a grand
feed! They were putting slices of pork between
cakes when we left. Besides, we lost our monkey!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know more about the natives now,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot more. They say grace and eat nurses!&rdquo; Stew
mocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t prove that. Perhaps the nurse gave
them her dog tag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine chance!&rdquo; Stew lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Jack was not thinking of the natives now, but
of Ted, Kentucky, and all the other fellows on the
<i>Black Bee</i>. &ldquo;If they attack Mindanao before we
get back to the ship, I&rsquo;ll never recover,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Stew stopped to listen.</p>
<p>Faint and far away they caught a long-drawn
wail like a bow drawn slowly over the C string
of a violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Howler is coming back to roost,&rdquo; said Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds that way,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! I&rsquo;d like to have one more look at that
plane!&rdquo; Stew said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a good look one of these times,&rdquo;
Jack assured him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen enough for one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood there listening until the howl of the
rapidly approaching mystery plane had reached its
height, then, as on that other night, wavered and
ceased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here all right,&rdquo; Stew said, as they paused
on a tall, barren rock to look back. On the spot
where the plane had been parked before, they
caught the gleam of a wavering light.</p>
<p>When they reached the beach, ready to start on
the last quarter mile of their walk, they paused
once more. The tide was coming in. Above the
rushing sound of the breakers on the beach they
had caught a <i>bump</i>&mdash;<i>bump</i>&mdash;<i>bump</i>. After ten seconds
of listening, they heard a loud crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Stew asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. Let&rsquo;s go see.&rdquo; Flashlight in hand,
Jack was clambering over the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a life raft,&rdquo; he called back a moment later.
&ldquo;Waves threw it on the rocks. Come on! Let&rsquo;s grab
it before a bigger wave carries it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a large raft, wet and slippery. They got
a good ducking before they had the raft high and
dry. They were soon to learn that it was worth
their effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Jap raft!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. He had discovered
Japanese characters on a sealed metal cannister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have come from a carrier,&rdquo; suggested
Jack. &ldquo;Too big for a cruiser or a destroyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it came from that carrier we spotted!&rdquo;
Stew exploded, becoming greatly excited. &ldquo;Boy! Oh
boy! Our bombers got them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Jack was not too sure of this. However, they soon
established the fact that the raft was undamaged and
had no broken lines attached to it, so it could not
have been blown from the carrier by a bomb. Then
Jack was convinced that the Japs must have lost the
raft in trying to launch it while under fire, and that
the carrier must have been sunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Means we&rsquo;ve been
some use to our country. I hope Ted and all the rest
got home safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great news!&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;But that means
our task force finished that job twenty-four hours
ago, so where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me,&rdquo; Jack sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;There are three or
four big sealed cans attached to the raft. Let&rsquo;s cut
them loose and take them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;Then
we&rsquo;ll open them and see what kind of luck we&rsquo;ve
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried away the three large cans, to open
them later by the light of a small fire built among
huge rocks, where the glow would not show.</p>
<p>One can they found to be filled with food&mdash;packages
of rice and tea, bars of bitter chocolate, and
small tins of fish. They put away these supplies
against some evil day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>The second can also contained some food. Besides
this there was a quantity of first-aid material.
Finding this in good condition, they stowed it away
carefully.</p>
<p>The last can promised to be the grand prize, provided
they could figure it out. It was a small radio
sending set, powered by electricity generated by
turning a crank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an imitation of our American emergency radio,&rdquo;
Jack declared after looking it over. &ldquo;Take a lot
of doping out, but it&rsquo;s our best bet for getting in
touch with our ship. We&rsquo;ll get busy on it first thing
in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added in a changed voice, &ldquo;how
would you like to grab a few winks of sleep while
I guard camp and solve some of the problems of the
universe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would suit me better.&rdquo; Stew yawned.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a gloomy little world Jack watched over
that night. Dark clouds had come rolling in at sunset.
They had thinned out a little now, giving the
moon an occasional peek at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just enough to give some prowler a shot at us
in the night,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself. He wished he
knew who those men were with the propellerless
plane. How was he to find out? Ask the natives? But
were these natives to be trusted? Missionaries had
beyond a doubt been here, but they weren&rsquo;t here
now. &ldquo;How long does it take these primitive people
to drop back into their old ways?&rdquo; he asked himself.
But he found no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things will work themselves out,&rdquo; he reasoned
hopefully.</p>
<p>After that he gave himself over to thoughts of the
folks at home. Dad and Mom seated by the fire&mdash;Patsy
in the house next door, studying perhaps, or
entertaining one of the 4-H boys. How shadowy and
far away it all seemed now.</p>
<p>He was deep in the midst of all this when suddenly,
as the moon cast a patch of light on his beach
and the cluster of palms not twenty yards away, he
was startled by a voice at his very elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist there! You!&rdquo; it whispered.</p>
<p>Startled, but standing his ground, he gripped his
automatic, then in his hoarsest whisper answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist back to you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NIGHT FIGHTERS</span></h2>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s conclusions regarding the <i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i>
fight with the Jap task force were correct. After
he and Stew had been driven from the scene of fighting
and had abandoned their plane on the sea, the
U. S. dive bombers had come in for their deadly
work. Diving from twelve thousand feet, they had
released their bombs at a thousand feet. Some
bombs missed their mark. Others made contact. One
fell forward on the Jap carrier, killing a gun crew.
Two fell almost directly on the propeller, rendering
it useless. While the carrier ran around in wide
circles, the torpedo bombers closed in. Judging the
enemy&rsquo;s probable position at a given moment, they
released their &ldquo;tin fish&rdquo; with such deadly accuracy
that one side of the carrier was blown away. Just
as the Japs began abandoning ship, the carrier blew
up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>A squadron of U. S. dive bombers that had arrived
too late to work on the carrier, went after the
fleeing cruisers, which did not pause to pick up their
own men struggling in the water. Two cruisers were
sunk, and one left in flames.</p>
<p>Ted had limped back to his own waters to make
a crash landing in the sea close to the <i>Black Bee</i>, and
to be picked up by a PT boat. All in all it was a
glorious fight. One U.S. fighter and his gunner were
permanently lost. They had been seen to fall flaming
into the sea. A service was read for these men by
the chaplain.</p>
<p>The Commander lost no time in letting his men
know that this battle was in the nature of an accident
and that the real goal of the task force at that
time still lay ahead.</p>
<p>All day they steamed rapidly toward the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mindanao,&rdquo; Kentucky, Ted&rsquo;s flying partner,
said to him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to hit them where they
live, in the Philippines. And will we take revenge!&rdquo;
Kentucky&rsquo;s eyes were half closed as he looked away
to the west. Ted knew that at that moment he was
thinking of &ldquo;the best pal I ever knowed,&rdquo; as Kentucky
had expressed it to him, whose grave had been
dug the day after the smoke cleared from Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the Commander tell you it was going to be
Mindanao?&rdquo; Ted asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I&rsquo;m plumb certain it has to be from the
course we&rsquo;re taking,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Just you wait
an&rsquo; see! Some evening about sundown we&rsquo;ll be
meetin&rsquo; up with another task force. An&rsquo; then, man!
You&rsquo;ll really see some fightin&rsquo; ships!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did fulfill a rendezvous at sunset, but the
force they met did not fit into Kentucky&rsquo;s picture.
It consisted of four transports, three cargo vessels
and their escorts, two cruisers, and three destroyers.</p>
<p>The two forces moved into position, then steamed
on toward the west. Two hours later the Commander
called Kentucky into the chart room. Since
Ted was with him at the time, he invited him to accompany
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You too may be in on this,&rdquo; he said to Ted as
they entered the brightly lighted cabin. &ldquo;So you
might as well know what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wasting no time, he led the boys to a large chart
spread out on a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where we are,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a
spot on the chart with a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is about where we were during the battle
with the Jap task force, is it not, sir?&rdquo; Ted too
pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said the Commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Jack and Stew, if they made it, are on one
of these three islands?&rdquo; Ted pointed again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;That seems probable.&rdquo; Then, reading the look
of longing on Ted&rsquo;s face, the Commander added,
&ldquo;Everything in its time, son. We do not desert our
boys if it can be helped. I am sure you shall yet play
a part in the rescue of your buddies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; his voice changed, &ldquo;there is other
work to be done&mdash;dangerous work. This island,&rdquo;
he pointed once again, &ldquo;is our present destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Mindanao then, sir?&rdquo; Kentucky heaved a
sigh of disappointment, for the Commander had
pointed to a small island just inside a coral reef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Mindanao this time.&rdquo; The Commander
smiled. &ldquo;This is to be a step in that direction. At
present we do not have a force large enough for
that undertaking. But some time we&rsquo;ll hit Mindanao,
and hit it hard,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good news, sir,&rdquo; said Kentucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we have another mission.&rdquo; The Commander&rsquo;s
voice dropped. &ldquo;The troops we are convoying
tonight are to be landed shortly after dawn.
Just before dawn we shall attack, using planes and
warships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tear them to pieces!&rdquo; Kentucky beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to. But first,&rdquo; the Commander weighed
his words, &ldquo;we may run into trouble. And that&rsquo;s
where you boys come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of trouble, sir?&rdquo; Ted asked quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Land-based torpedo planes, perhaps.&rdquo; The Commander
spoke slowly. &ldquo;We are not quite sure the
Japs have them. We do know there&rsquo;s a landing field
on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take them fast enough if they come after
us, sir.&rdquo; Kentucky squared his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night it is not so easy,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night!&rdquo; Ted stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your squadron has been making practice flights
at night recently,&rdquo; said the Commander. &ldquo;That
wasn&rsquo;t for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I suppose not.&rdquo; Ted was trying to think what
going after torpedo bombers at night would be like.
&ldquo;Exciting,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past,&rdquo; the Commander spoke once more,
&ldquo;our task forces have been destroying their torpedo
planes long before they reached us in the daytime.
So&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re going to come after us in the dark,
sir?&rdquo; Kentucky suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Intelligence Service has strongly hinted at
it,&rdquo; said the Commander. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he drew a deep
breath, &ldquo;I thought you, Kentucky, would like to
call for four volunteers to be ready for night fighting,
just in case they come after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in on that, sir&mdash;that is, if you think
I&rsquo;m good enough,&rdquo; Ted volunteered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re plenty good,&rdquo; said Kentucky. &ldquo;Your
plane was shot up. Got a new one yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure have, same kind of a plane,&rdquo; said Ted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Then you&rsquo;re on,&rdquo; Kentucky agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in the vicinity of the island by midnight,&rdquo;
said the Commander. &ldquo;Have your planes in
position ready to take off at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Two
destroyers will move in close far ahead of us. If Jap
planes take off they will notify us. You won&rsquo;t forget
the soldiers crowded on those transports? Transports
are vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t forget, sir.&rdquo; There was a look of determination
on Kentucky&rsquo;s lean face as he left the
chart room.</p>
<p>It was an hour after midnight when word came
from the radio cabin that twelve night torpedo
bombers had left the shore of the Jap-held island.</p>
<p>At once there was hurried, excited action, but no
confusion. The four night fighter planes were
warmed up. The fliers took their places, tested their
guns, studied their instruments, then settled back.</p>
<p>Besides Kentucky and Ted, there were Red Garber
and Blackie Dawson. The ship carried no better
fighters than these.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, fellows,&rdquo; Kentucky called just before
they parted, &ldquo;the thing to do is to rip right in
and get them confused. That way they&rsquo;ll think there
are a lot of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll start shooting one another up,&rdquo; Red
laughed.</p>
<p>One by one they cleared the deck to soar away
into the night.</p>
<p>The night was not all dark. The moon came out
at times, but not for long. Clouds went scudding
across the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not a moment too soon,&rdquo; Ted thought as
in a brief period of moonlight he caught sight of
a dark bulk against the night sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&rdquo; came in a quiet tone over his
radio. It was Kentucky speaking. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bear down
on them. Can&rsquo;t hold formation. Every man for himself.
Choose your targets carefully. We can&rsquo;t have
lights on. They&rsquo;d get us sure. But let <i>us</i> not shoot
one another up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They bore down upon the advancing enemy.</p>
<p>It was an exciting moment, but to Ted everything
seemed strangely unreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a dream,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>He knew soon enough that it was no dream. Underestimating
their combined speed, he almost ran
into the foremost enemy plane. He was seen, but
by the time guns rattled, he was not there. Going
into a stall, he circled left, then came up below the
bomber formation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had a look at them,&rdquo; he told himself.
They were powerful two-motored planes. He had
tried as he passed under them to estimate their
speed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, off to the right there came the quick
rat-tat-tat of machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Kentucky!&rdquo; He thrilled to his fingertips.
&ldquo;I wonder what luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all the time he had for speculation. He
was now behind the enemy formation, swinging into
position. And there, again, was the moon. To his
great joy, he found that the bombers were between
him and the moon, where they could be clearly seen.</p>
<p>With a sudden increase in speed he came up on
the last plane, let out a burst of fire, then, swinging
right, poured a second volley into the next
plane. Then again all was dark.</p>
<p>To his surprise, in the midst of this darkness
he heard gunfire&mdash;heard it again, and yet again.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re at it!&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;Fighting one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then suddenly the sky about him was all alight.
A hundred yards away a big Jap plane had burst
into flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>With a gasp, he pointed his plane&rsquo;s nose down
and dropped into space. He was not a second too
soon, for the exploding plane all but blew him into
the sea.</p>
<p>When he had righted himself, he wondered momentarily
whether or not that plane was his kill.</p>
<p>Then the moon came out. By that time some of
the bombers, now badly scattered, were some distance
away. Once again the moon painted a picture.
A small plane, like a catbird after a hawk,
darted at the bomber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky!&rdquo; he shouted aloud. &ldquo;Good old Kentucky!
Give it to him!&rdquo; He saw the flash of fire,
heard the rattle, then his picture was gone.</p>
<p>Ten seconds later the sky was lighted once again
by a burning bomber sinking toward the sea.</p>
<p>Off to the left another bomber exploded with a
roar. One of the other night fighters had gotten his
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re scattered now,&rdquo; Ted thought as he set
his plane climbing. &ldquo;Their torpedoes will never
reach their marks. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted. The moon having
come out once more, he found himself above a Jap
torpedo plane. Tilting his plane at a rakish angle he
fired straight down. His shots were answered by a
burst of fire from a small free machine gun. The
slugs ripped into his motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>He caught his breath. Banking sharply, he swung
away to the right, then started climbing. Up he
went, a thousand&mdash;two thousand feet. He smelled
smoke, saw a tiny flame play about his motor, and
that was all.</p>
<p>With care and speed born of much training, he
dragged out his life raft, inflated it, looked to his
parachute, threw back the hood, stood up, climbed
upon the fuselage, jumped far and wide, then shot
downward.</p>
<p>Five seconds later he felt the pull of his parachute,
then settled back to drift silently down
toward a blue-black sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What terrible luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In that moment all that he had hoped for seemed
lost&mdash;his part in the big show of the morning, the
rescue of his pals, the great attack on Mindanao. If
he survived, where would he land? Would he be
picked up? How soon? And by whom? To these
questions he found no answers, so settling back he
prayed for what he needed most&mdash;a bit of moonlight
before he hit those black waters. And his simple
prayer was answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">UP AT DAWN</span></h2>
<p>When Jack was still in grade school he had
often visited his uncle&rsquo;s farm. In summer he
had stayed for weeks at a time. There were ghosts
that haunted the lonely country roads at night. Old
Jock Gordon, the hired hand, and Maggie MacPherson,
the cook, often told weird tales about these
ghosts as they sat by the kitchen fire at night.</p>
<p>When he was out late playing with some neighbor
boy and had to brave the dark roads alone, Jack had
gone on tiptoe. But that didn&rsquo;t always help, for more
than once he saw weird white things moving in the
hedge or the willows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts!&rdquo; he would think, scared to death. But
he never ran. A ghost at your back is much more
terrible than one you can see. Jack always walked
straight toward the ghosts, and always they vanished
into thin air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>As he caught the hoarse whisper there on the
lonely mysterious island, he thought of those ghosts,
and it steadied his mind. He answered the hoarse
whisper, then walked straight toward the spot from
whence it came. He had gone a dozen paces when
a low voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping his gun, he stopped.</p>
<p>Out of the brush and the shadows stepped a figure
that even in the dim moonlight appeared familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; a woman&rsquo;s voice
asked. &ldquo;How did you come? And why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman was tall, and rather slender. She
wore a broad hat that hid her face.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that slim queen of the island, was Jack&rsquo;s
thought. He had come to think of her as just that,
but was astonished to discover that she spoke English
fluently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? And what are you doing here?&rdquo;
he countered, taking two steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who I am,&rdquo; came slowly. &ldquo;It
will pay you to stay where you are. I am not alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack remained where he was. He seemed to catch
sight of shadowy figures in the brush. Visions of
flying spears and arrows haunted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re two fliers from the United States Navy,&rdquo;
he said, having decided to tell the truth. &ldquo;Our plane
was wrecked. We came ashore on a rubber raft.
Now, who are you?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to know that you are speaking the
truth?&rdquo; the girl asked, ignoring his question.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Jap raft drawn up on the beach,&rdquo; she
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We drew it up.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s throat went dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you came in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a Jap?&rdquo; He played his flashlight
on his own face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like a Jap, but you might be a German.
All the traders were Germans before the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Have it your way!&rdquo; He threw a flash
of light into her eyes. By doing this, he discovered
an added pair of eyes&mdash;small, monkey eyes. The
monk was on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your monkey?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get that American nurse&rsquo;s identification
tag the monkey wears?&rdquo; He asked without
thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; There was anger in her voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
none of your affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on after a moment, &ldquo;We want to know
about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you know.&rdquo; He laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; She returned the laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know all about those fellows who come
here in that queer sort of plane?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; she came back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, that makes two of us. Thanks for
listenin&rsquo;. Good night.&rdquo; She was gone.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s heard that farewell off here on the radio,
Jack thought. Did missionaries have radios? He supposed
they did. Queer little world he had dropped
into. So she didn&rsquo;t know much about those two men
and the mystery plane? Well, one way or another,
<i>he</i> was going to learn more. If they turned out to be
Australian, British, or Dutch, they might give the
boys a lift to some spot held by the United Nations.
Then Stew and he would get back in time for the
big push against Mindanao, he thought. Worth taking
a chance for that, he assured himself. A very
long chance.</p>
<p class="tb">When Kentucky and two of his night fighting
comrades made their way back to the carrier they
were greeted with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it!&rdquo; The Commander gripped Kentucky&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;You broke up their formation! Not
a torpedo found its mark. But where is Ted?&rdquo; His
voice dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; said Kentucky, wrinkling
his brow. &ldquo;We had to scatter, and go on our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Red saw him climbing for altitude, sir&mdash;thought
his motor might have been smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. That&rsquo;s the way it was,&rdquo; Red put in.
&ldquo;After that the moon went under for quite a while.
When it came out his plane was gone. I thought I
saw a white gleam like a parachute in the moonlight
quite close to the water, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hope he made a safe landing,&rdquo; said the
Commander. &ldquo;We have to go in about a hundred
miles. The Marines go ashore at dawn. We must
furnish them a protecting screen. You boys have
done a fine job. Now get some chow and rest. We&rsquo;ll
need you again soon. It&rsquo;s going to be a long pull
for you, but this is war.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The moon had come out just in time for Ted&rsquo;s
landing. He sank beneath the sea, lost his grip on
the rubber raft, then came up for air.</p>
<p>The moon was still out. His raft was some ten
yards away. After disengaging himself from his
chute, he swam to the raft, then worked himself into
it with great care. This accomplished, he paddled to
his chute, squeezed the water out of it as best he
could, then deposited it on one end of the raft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>He took off his clothing. The air was warm. He
was not uncomfortable. After wringing out his
clothes he put them all on again except his heavy
flying jacket. He was warm enough without wearing
the jacket.</p>
<p>Then, with feet on the chute and head on the
inflated edge of the raft, he sprawled out in absolute
repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can do right now,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;Might get a little sleep.&rdquo; He recalled the
words of his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have to bail out and land on the sea,&rdquo;
his father had said. &ldquo;If you happen to find yourself
in a fix like that,&rdquo; his father had rambled on, &ldquo;you
may feel like praying that there will be no violent
storms, that God may send birds to light on your
raft so you can catch and eat them, that He&rsquo;ll send
fish, not sharks&mdash;all that sort of thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you feel that way about it,&rdquo; his father
had paused, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do you any harm. But for my
part, I&rsquo;d rather pray for wisdom and skill, for the
good sense to relax and take it easy, to save my
strength and my skill for catching fish and birds
and preparing them for food. I&rsquo;m convinced that
there is a power within us or about us that does
give us both skill and wisdom if we only ask for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A power within us or about us,&rdquo; Ted repeated
slowly, &ldquo;that gives us skill and wisdom.&rdquo; At that,
rocked by small waves, he fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Kentucky never needed much rest when he was
in a fighting mood. Two hours of sleep, a stack of
pancakes, three cups of black coffee, and he was
ready to lead his fighters out over the island that
lay like a dark, gray shadow rising out of the sea
in the first flush of dawn.</p>
<p>One by one the planes left the carrier. Fighters,
scout planes, dive bombers, torpedo planes&mdash;all
thundered away toward their target.</p>
<p>Leading them all, Kentucky felt important and
very happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot diggity!&rdquo; he exclaimed to the morning air.
&ldquo;This is what I call life! And here&rsquo;s where we pay
the Japs a little on account for Pearl Harbor.&rdquo; He
was thinking of little Joe Kreider, his pal from Kentucky.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone, Kentucky thought soberly. Japs got
him in that sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. Gone,
but not forgotten. He gave his motor a fresh burst
of gas.</p>
<p>Then he saw it, a big old four-motored Jap
snooper slipping out for a look at their carrier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot dog!&rdquo; Kentucky&rsquo;s plane shot skyward and
then came plunging down in a steep curve. His two
guns poured hot lead into the snooper&rsquo;s right outside
motor. The motor, almost cut away, hung by
shreds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Before the snooper could right itself, Kentucky
was back, firing away at the other right motor. He
set it smoking. The big plane tilted, rolled over,
then went plunging toward the sea.</p>
<p>All this had happened in the space of seconds.
Enough time had elapsed, however, for other things
to be brewing. Suddenly two of his fighting pals
joined him, while from up beyond there came the
sharp <i>rat-a-tat-tat</i> of machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>Rubbing his eyes, Kentucky peered into the
brightening dawn. A half mile or so before him
he made out the shadowy forms of several planes
circling wildly, with guns blazing.</p>
<p>His triggerlike mind took in the situation in an
instant. &ldquo;Hey! Red! Blackie! Jean!&rdquo; he roared into
his radio. &ldquo;Hold up! Circle Back! BACK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they began swinging back, speaking in a low
tone, he continued: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a bunch of Zeros
putting on a show for us. It looks like a fight, but
it&rsquo;s only a sham battle. None of our planes are in
there. We&rsquo;re in the lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through his earphones he caught low grumbles
and some unprintable words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;Get into formation.
You know the lineup. We&rsquo;ll join in their
game, all right, but on our own terms.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>They climbed rapidly and joined in wing-to-wing
formation, Kentucky in the lead and Red bringing
up the rear. Red carried a gunner, the best the
Navy knew, in his rear cockpit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Come on down! And give it to them for
my old pal Joe and all the American boys lost at
Pearl Harbor!&rdquo; Kentucky shouted into his mike.
And down they came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE JET PLANE</span></h2>
<p>In the meantime Jack had decided on a bold
stroke. He was not sure that at this time it was
a wise thing to do, but his burning desire to make
his way back to the carrier and resume his post
of duty there had all but driven him to it.</p>
<p>As he paced back and forth on the beach, guarding
camp and wondering about his strange night
visitor, he recalled the words of his uncle Dan who
had fought in the first World War:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be in danger many times,&rdquo; he had said in
a serious, friendly voice. &ldquo;Your superior officers will
not always be present to make decisions for you.
You&rsquo;ll sometimes have to make them for yourself.
Always keep this thought uppermost in your mind:
you are worth a great deal more to your country
alive than dead. Don&rsquo;t take unnecessary chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I planning to take unnecessary chances
now?&rdquo; he asked himself. Though he did not know
the answer, he was willing to take the risk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>One more thing had made a lasting impression
on him. &ldquo;Jack, my boy,&rdquo; said his uncle, who limped
as a result of wounds received in France, &ldquo;the thing
I want most to tell you is this. While you are in
service you will have comrades, many boon companions,
and if you treat them right, as I know you
will, you&rsquo;re sure to make attachments that will last
as long as you live. You see, Jack, you&rsquo;ll be living
under difficult conditions, enduring hardships, and
facing great dangers together. Your souls will be
tried as by fire and you&rsquo;ll be welded together, the
way steel is welded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Jack thought now, Uncle Dan was right.
We have grown closer and closer to one another.
There&rsquo;s Stew and Ted, Kentucky, Red, the Commander,
and all the others. We&rsquo;ll never forget one
another. That&rsquo;s one reason why I&rsquo;m so eager to
get back to the <i>Black Bee</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, he decided finally, I&rsquo;ll do it, even if it does
mean taking a chance. I&rsquo;ll do it the first thing in
the morning.</p>
<p>Then he awakened Stew for his watch, stretched
himself out, and fell asleep at once.</p>
<p>He was up again before dawn. &ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo;
he exclaimed over a cup of coffee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
find out who those fellows are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men with that queer plane?&rdquo; Stew asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We&rsquo;ve got to know. They might help us
get back to our ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then again they might not&mdash;they might do
just the opposite,&rdquo; Stew suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;ll have to take. You&rsquo;d better
stay here and sort of look after things,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;I may discover something big. We might
want to get off this island in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off?&rdquo; Stew stared. &ldquo;Yes, but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Jap raft, you know. It&rsquo;s seaworthy.
We&rsquo;ve got supplies of a sort, enough to last us weeks
with the birds and fish we&rsquo;d catch. If it seemed the
thing to do, we could slip the raft out into the current
and get away rather rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Stew agreed.</p>
<p>Jack stood up. Should he tell Stew of the night
visitor? After a moment&rsquo;s thought he decided against
that.</p>
<p>A half hour later, after hurrying over the native
trail, he found himself slipping silently through the
brush toward the camp of the strangers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
look before I show myself,&rdquo; he whispered to the
empty air.</p>
<p>All of a sudden he stopped to listen. A low, whispering
wail had reached his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late.&rdquo; His hopes fell. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off.&rdquo; Yet as
he listened the wail died away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably testing their motors,&rdquo; he assumed.
Once more he crept through the brush. Three times
the wail rose and fell, but he pushed straight on until
the smoke from a campfire told him he was close
to the edge of the tangled mass of palms and tropical
brush beside the strangers&rsquo; camp.</p>
<p>Choosing a young date palm, whose fronds
sprouted close to the ground, he crept to it and
crouched there a minute. Rising to his knees, he
parted the slender fronds to look away to the sloping
rock.</p>
<p>The mysterious plane was some distance away.
The two men talked and laughed while they refueled
the plane. The language they spoke seemed
strange to Jack, though he was too far away to understand
what they said, even if they had spoken
English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I hadn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he observed. Then, &ldquo;But
I really must know about them. No sense beating
about the bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men ceased laughing. The sound of their
words changed. One of them climbed to the plane&rsquo;s
cockpit. The motor howled once more. So loud was
its final scream that it hurt Jack&rsquo;s ears. Then it
faded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be off in a minute,&rdquo; he breathed, rising
to his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>No. He settled back. The man on the rock hurried
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Jerry!&rdquo; the one in the plane called in perfect
English. &ldquo;Bring an alligator wrench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack heaved a sigh of relief. So they spoke English!
They must be okay. At that he stepped boldly
out from the brush and walked straight toward the
plane. The man in the cockpit was bent over working
on something. He did not raise his head until
Jack was within three yards of the plane. When he
did look up, he started at the sight of Jack. His
figure stiffened. His right hand dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;Who
are you? What do you want? And how did you come
here?&rdquo; The man spoke with a decided accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uniform should tell you what I am,&rdquo; Jack
replied evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In war, uniforms mean nothing!&rdquo; the man
snapped. His gray eyes matched the gray of the
bushy hair about his temples. He was no longer
young. Between his eyes were two lines that told
of work and strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Jack apologized. &ldquo;I had no intention
of startling you. I&rsquo;m an American fighter pilot,
whether you believe it or not. I was shot down
nearly two days ago and floated ashore here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, son.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s smile was not unfriendly.
His accent, Jack thought, made him English
or Australian. &ldquo;We have to be careful, that&rsquo;s
all. This plane is a secret weapon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; Jack grinned. &ldquo;I never before saw
one that burned kerosene, had no propeller, and
yet went like the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; the man admitted. &ldquo;There
aren&rsquo;t a dozen of them in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I look at it?&rdquo; Jack took a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a glance. Stay where you are.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s
lips formed a straight line. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not allowed to
show anything. In fact, you&rsquo;re too close right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; Jack stepped back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just naturally curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure.&rdquo; The man smiled again. &ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ll
climb down and we&rsquo;ll have a cup of coffee. My partner&rsquo;s
gone for some tools. The hiding place is quite
a distance away, just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Just in case the Japs happen
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; the man agreed. He took
a step down, then paused. &ldquo;You might be wondering
how we got our supply of kerosene in here right
under the Japs&rsquo; noses,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem odd,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;It happens to have been here,&rdquo; the stranger
went on. To his own surprise Jack found himself
wondering if the man was telling him the truth or
raising a smoke screen of falsehood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, my partner and I once had trading concessions
on some of these islands. The Japs forced
us off, but before they did that we hid our fuel.
Thought we might want to come back, which we
did. But we hardly expected to come in a craft like
this.&rdquo; He laughed softly.</p>
<p>The man climbed down, poured two cups of hot
black coffee from a gallon thermos jug, then invited
Jack to a seat on a large flat rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you like our little ship!&rdquo; the man said,
warmed by the coffee. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a honey. Nothing
in the world was ever like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure walks on air,&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve seen it fly?&rdquo; He gave Jack a sharp look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Jack told of seeing it leave the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to know a lot about it?&rdquo; The man
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some things I can&rsquo;t tell you. All I can tell you
has been printed in magazines all over the world.
Strange you haven&rsquo;t read them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been at sea for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; The man appeared to have accepted
Jack&rsquo;s story as true. &ldquo;And the facts about our
jet plane haven&rsquo;t been out very long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jet plane? Is that what you call it?&rdquo; Jack studied
the plane with redoubled interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is. It gets its power from jets
of air mixed with exploding gas. The jets come out
from some part of the plane. I&rsquo;m not permitted to
tell exactly what part. You&rsquo;ve often watered a lawn,
I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember how the hose sort of kicked back
when the water came rushing out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Jack grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been soaked more
than once by just that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of thing that makes our ship go.
The jets come out at great speed and just push the
plane along. It practically flies itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about taking me along on your next flight?&rdquo;
Jack held his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible. We can&rsquo;t take a soul on board. No,
not even if he were wounded and would die if we
left him. It&rsquo;s that much of a secret. So much&mdash;so
very much depends upon this plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you a little more about it,&rdquo; the man
went on, sensing Jack&rsquo;s disappointment. &ldquo;It burns
kerosene. You&rsquo;ve noticed that, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard on fuel. We have to carry a belly tank
if we want to go far. The Italians made a plane
somewhat like this one. But it just ate up the fuel.
If you&rsquo;ve got to land every half hour for fuel, your
plane&rsquo;s no good. We&rsquo;ve overcome that. But this
plane still has weak spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack wondered what the weak spots were, but
dared not ask. &ldquo;Should be fine in the stratosphere,&rdquo;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! You <i>do</i> know planes, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the man
answered with respect in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Jack admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s good in the stratosphere. That&rsquo;s
where a propeller-driven plane breaks down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for the propeller to get its teeth into,&rdquo;
suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But our baby here goes fastest
when there&rsquo;s the thinnest sort of air in front of her
to create friction. Five hundred miles an hour? Say!
That&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stared at the plane with sheer admiration.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jerry, the stranger&rsquo;s partner, came up
with an alligator wrench in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get busy and step out on the air.&rdquo; With
that Jack&rsquo;s newly found friend was gone, just like
that. Nor did he return. Not five minutes had passed
when the mystery plane let out the squeal of an
expiring porker, lifted its voice to the pitch of a
fire siren, started to glide, touched the sea, cast back
a spray, then was in the air and flew swiftly away.</p>
<p>Jack had searched for the plane to make whatever
discovery he could concerning it, but he was not
sure that he had accomplished anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TED&rsquo;S GONY</span></h2>
<p>On that same morning, as the <i>Black Bee</i> and her
escort of fighting ships knifed in close to their
target, Kentucky and his short, tight formation cut
through the masquerading Japs like a reaper
through a field of wheat. When their guns had
ceased blazing away and they swung around for
one more sweep, they saw two planes falling in
flames, and a third rolling over and over.</p>
<p>The remaining Japs had time to recover partially
from the sudden shock, but when the &ldquo;grim
reapers&rdquo; came roaring back, the Zeros were again
swept by a whirlwind of fire.</p>
<p>One wise little brown boy in goggles, who had
climbed high, came swooping down on the tail of
a plane, but its gunner took care of him with neatness
and dispatch.</p>
<p>With their number cut in half, the Zeros faded
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>But here were the U. S. bombers and torpedo
planes. They were coming in fast. It was time now
to join the covering screen escorting the big boys
to their target, and Kentucky wheeled his four-plane
formation about to shoot away and join their comrades.</p>
<p>The bombers had been shown maps and photographs
of the island they were to attack. &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
their Commander had said, pointing at a map, &ldquo;is
the air field, quite a distance from the beach. You
will go after that first, destroying all planes on the
ground. Then you will attack their headquarters
here, and their fortified positions there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not tell you,&rdquo; he had said, addressing all
his men&mdash;pilots, fighters, bombardiers, torpedo men&mdash;&ldquo;that
the life of many a Marine depends upon
the manner in which you perform your task. I know
that to a man we can count on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been a low murmur in response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might say,&rdquo; the Commander had added, &ldquo;that
this island is to be a steppingstone to Mindanao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mindanao! Mindanao!&rdquo; had come in a
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mindanao, only a few hundred miles away,
in the Philippines,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And with this
island in our possession we shall be able to soften
up Mindanao for the final attack.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mindanao,&rdquo; Kentucky thought now as he
gripped the controls. &ldquo;They say the Japs have a
prison camp there, where our men are starving and
dying. We&rsquo;ll walk in there some day and take that
big island. We&rsquo;ll free the prisoners. What a day
that will be! Then it&rsquo;s Manila, and after that the
China coast. Boy! Will we harvest a sweet revenge
for the things those Japs have done to the American
prisoners!&rdquo; He studied his instruments, looked to
the loading of his guns, glanced back at his formation,
then, drawing a long breath, murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tojo, here we come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dive bombers climbed to twelve thousand
feet. Kentucky and his fighters kept straight on. As
they neared the island he spoke a few words of
instruction through his mike to his three companions.
Words came back to him. Then, opening
his throttle wide, he set his motor roaring. Coming
in fast and low, they took the Japs by surprise.
Scores of little brown men were racing for the airfield
when they came in, nearly grazing the palm
trees. Some thirty planes were still on the field.</p>
<p>Breaking formation, the &ldquo;four horsemen&rdquo; zoomed
in upon the planes and the racing pilots. With machine-gun
fire they sent the Japs scurrying for shelter.
Then with tracer bullets they riddled the
grounded planes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Leaving the field in flames, they swung skyward
to rejoin the screen of fighters, bombers, and torpedo
planes.</p>
<p>Ten minutes more and the air was filled with the
rattle of machine-gun fire and the island became
an inferno of bursting bombs.</p>
<p>The torpedo planes discovered three cargo ships
and two destroyers in the small harbor and, coming
in low, released their &ldquo;tin fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bursting torpedoes added their horror to the general
confusion of sound. A ship exploded, another
keeled over and sank, and a third was run aground.
Jap destroyers streaked away, but even their top
speed was no match for Kentucky and his followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After them, fellows!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Remember
Pearl Harbor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Skimming in over the sea, they peppered the deck
of a destroyer with slugs until not a man was left
standing on deck. Lowering their aim, they began
to puncture the destroyer&rsquo;s thin hull.</p>
<p>A film of oil appeared on the water. &ldquo;Give it to
her!&rdquo; Kentucky shouted into his phone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
struck oil. Let&rsquo;s make it a gusher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a dive bomber came screaming down
to lay its egg squarely on the destroyer&rsquo;s deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That got her!&rdquo; Kentucky exulted, as the craft
exploded. &ldquo;Come on now. Gas is low. Let&rsquo;s beat it
back home for chow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>It was such a day as a flier would never forget.</p>
<p>As they sped away, Marines from barges and
small boats were swarming ashore. The stepping
stone to Mindanao was now all but won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; Kentucky exclaimed into his mike. &ldquo;I
wish Jack and Stew&mdash;yes, and Ted too&mdash;could have
been in on this. Wonder where Ted is right now?
We&rsquo;ll have to take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Ted was not faring badly. The balmy breezes
had dried out his clothes, and dawn had come, but
there was no sign of their task force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone in for the kill and then the landing,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m out of it. Worse luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Things might be
worse.&rdquo; He had done his bit. He had helped block
the attack of those enemy torpedo bombers, and he
had shot down two of them&mdash;he was quite sure of
that.</p>
<p>He munched a chocolate bar for a time. Then
he examined the fishline packed in his emergency
kit. &ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll try it out,&rdquo; he murmured. Taking
a strip of pork rind from a small bottle, he fastened
it on his hook. Then, paying out the line little by
little, he watched the white spot as it sank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are fish!&rdquo; He became greatly excited
as three big blue fellows came cruising in. One of
them made a dive for the bait, but changed his
mind and shot away.</p>
<p>Ted lifted the line a yard, causing the white spot
to shoot upward. A second fish made a dive for it,
but before he made contact the first one circled
back like a plane aiming at a target, and grabbed
the lure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got you!&rdquo; Ted breathed, giving the line a quick
jerk.</p>
<p>He had hooked him, but the fish was game. He
shot this way, then that, then circled round and
round.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want him any more than a little, Ted
thought. I&rsquo;m not hungry enough to eat raw fish, and
in this sun he wouldn&rsquo;t keep. He began playing the
fish, trying him out.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, a large blue shadow appeared
in the water, a darting shadow. No, it wasn&rsquo;t
a shadow&mdash;it was a ten-foot shark. Streaking through
the water, sleek and ugly, the shark hypnotized the
boy. This lasted only ten seconds, but long enough.
Too late Ted realized that he was about to exchange
his blue fish for a shark.</p>
<p>The shark swallowed the fish, hook and all. At
once Ted felt the line shoot through his fingers.
Gripping desperately, he checked the line. He felt
his raft being towed rapidly through the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>The shark went down. The raft tilted at a dangerous
angle. A hundred thoughts sped through the
boy&rsquo;s mind. He might be lost for days, perhaps
weeks. Without food he must perish. No line, no
fish, no food. But if the raft went over? What then?
Soaked to the skin, he would in the end be obliged
to yield his line. Then a happy thought struck him.
In his emergency kit were other hooks, and in his
parachute many lines. He opened his hands, the line
slid through his fingers. The raft settled back. He
was safe. The shark was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he exclaimed, rubbing his burned fingers.
&ldquo;This life on a raft is not all it&rsquo;s cracked up to
be. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by the rumble of
thunder off in the distance. Or was it thunder?</p>
<p>He listened more closely. &ldquo;Bombs!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made contact! Hurrah! Hit &rsquo;em hard and
often, boys! Hit &rsquo;em hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they take the island? He knew they would.
No stopping the victorious Americans now. Island
after island had fallen into their hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Other victories would follow. This island today,
he thought. Mindanao the day after tomorrow. If
only I can get back to the fleet before we tackle
Mindanao, he thought with a touch of despair.
&ldquo;God, send someone to pick me up,&rdquo; he prayed.
&ldquo;Please God, I don&rsquo;t know much. Give me wisdom.
Help me to get food from the sea and the sky. Send
me back to my buddies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that there didn&rsquo;t seem to be much left to
do but rest, relax, and watch for smoke on the
horizon or a plane in the sky.</p>
<p>The rumble from the west died away, then rose
again. The battle might last all day. Cruisers and
destroyers would move in to shell Jap positions. The
carrier would stand by. Perhaps the task force would
slip away under cover of darkness. &ldquo;If it does that,
I&rsquo;ll be sunk,&rdquo; he murmured disconsolately.</p>
<p>He had managed to bring along a small canteen.
He took a sip of water. He recalled that you were
supposed to be able to get water by pressing out fish
meat. He&rsquo;d have to try that.</p>
<p>The sun was hot. It had been a tough night. He
was tired and his head ached. Finally he stretched
himself out and fell asleep.</p>
<p>A little more than an hour later he awoke with a
start, clutched at his head with sudden violence,
and grasped something hard and horny with each
hand. He held on grimly, though his head and
shoulders were being beaten unmercifully by something
hard and sharp as a crowbar. He let out a gasp
as some knifelike thing cut at his wrist, but still he
held on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>At last, half standing up, he gave a mighty heave
to bring a great bird with a ten-foot wing spread,
down upon his raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! A gony!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You rascal! You
nearly wrecked me! What were you doing on top
of my head? Resting? Well, I&rsquo;ll give you a good,
long rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bird was an albatross, largest of all sea birds.
Ted had learned a great deal about them from the
old sailors, who called them gonies. They followed
ships for thousands of miles, sleeping on the sea, or
soaring miles on end, with their long, narrow wings
spread wide.</p>
<p>This one, beyond a doubt, had been following
their task force, but had been frightened away by
the big guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do with you?&rdquo; he demanded of the
bird.</p>
<p>His answer was a snap on the ankle from its
powerful jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should kill and eat you,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
worse than a Jap! But I won&rsquo;t&mdash;not yet. Men don&rsquo;t
eat gonies unless they have to. It&rsquo;s supposed to bring
bad luck. I&rsquo;ll tie you up, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do. Then
we&rsquo;ll try our luck together. If I&rsquo;m rescued, you go
free. If not, you get eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The gony winked as if he really understood. Then
for good measure, he nipped at Ted&rsquo;s ankle once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be some company,&rdquo; Ted said, as after
binding the bird&rsquo;s feet, he fastened a wide strap
taken from his parachute about its wings and body.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon he caught a fairly large fish.
After pressing water from its meat, he drank a little.
&ldquo;Not impossible,&rdquo; was his verdict. He ate some of
the meat, then offered a bite to his gony, who, to
his surprise, swallowed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be a young fellow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Friendly
and green, like myself.&rdquo; He laughed, and felt better.</p>
<p>Just as the sun was sinking in the west he saw a
dark smudge that soon obscured the sun. &ldquo;A ship!&rdquo;
He became greatly excited. Another smudge, and
yet another. &ldquo;The task force!&rdquo; he exclaimed, standing
up and nearly overturning his raft. &ldquo;If only it
would come this way!&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SECRET BOOK</span></h2>
<p>On the island of mysteries Jack watched with
increasing astonishment as the jet plane soared
away. It climbed up until it looked to be the size
of a star, let out a scream, then faded with the speed
of sound into the blue sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some plane!&rdquo; he exclaimed, straining his eyes
for one last glimpse of it. A plane like that could
change the whole science of aviation. Yes, it&rsquo;s a
military secret, but whose secret? That&rsquo;s the question.
He was about to begin his homeward journey
when a book, lying on the rocks, caught his attention.</p>
<p><i>Murder at Midnight</i>, he read on the cover. &ldquo;So
that&rsquo;s what they read!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up the book, he flipped it open, then a
whistle escaped his lips. Two thirds of the pages of
the original book had been replaced by pages on
which clippings had been pasted. &ldquo;A scrapbook!
How strange!&rdquo; He stood staring at it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>A moment later he nearly dropped it in his excitement.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about that mysterious plane!
What a find!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Sitting down upon a flat rock, he began to read.
There were articles in English, French, German,
and Italian. Many he could not read at all, but the
articles in English were more than enough to satisfy
his curiosity. Much that he read about equalizers,
reflecting blades, direpeller blades, slip streams, and
burbles he understood only in part. At last he came
to an article which gave him the desired information.
This article read in part:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocket propulsion, of course, is not a new thing;
the basic idea is centuries old. As applied to aerial
warfare it was employed on a crude basis even in
World War I. The Italians made public an experimental
flight of a propellerless jet-type plane several
years ago. Long before that, automobiles were driven
by rocket engines, and special rockets for making
meteorological soundings in the substratosphere
were in use....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, the Anglo-American jet-propelled
airplane represents the broadest application of the
principle yet achieved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;The jet plane carries no oxygen for its engine:
its jet propulsion engine uses oxygen from the air.
This engine has fewer parts and is of simpler construction
than the traditional engine. It operates
a mechanism which compresses the air. This air is
mixed with atomized fuels such as gasoline, kerosene,
alcohol, or some other fuels of the hydrocarbon
family, rich in hydrogen. From that point forward
the operation is the same as in the rocket
engine; that is to say, the gas is released and ignited,
the resulting expansion and emission through the
jet providing the power....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The development of the jet engine was made
possible by a number of recent scientific achievements.
One was the development of new alloys
capable of withstanding extreme heat. The gases in
combustion produce temperatures of 1500 degrees
and over, and it is only in recent years that materials
to resist such temperatures have been produced....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoothness, simplicity, and evenness of power
are three of the principal characteristics reported by
pilots who have flown the new fighter plane powered
by jet propulsion....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;Says one flier who has flown this plane: &lsquo;It is
the smoothest ride I&rsquo;ve ever experienced in any
plane. The first time I climbed into the cockpit I
was naturally a little nervous about first contact with
an entirely new method of propulsion. My nervousness
persisted while I started the engines and until
I started to taxi across the field for the take-off; then
it dawned on me that this plane was even simpler to
operate than a primary trainer. I flew it through all
the maneuvers I wanted for twenty minutes, then
landed, and taxied up to the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wanted to check the fuel before resuming
flight, so before turning on the main switch to read
the electrical fuel gauges, I stuck my head out of
the cockpit and shouted, to warn the mechanics to
stay clear of the propeller, completely forgetting
that I didn&rsquo;t have any propeller.&rsquo;...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jet propulsion is necessary if we are to exceed
the possibilities of propellers. A propeller literally
screws its way through the air. The blades cause a
partial vacuum. The greater the density of the air,
the greater is the efficiency of the propeller. As we
rise, the air becomes thinner. Finally a point is
reached at which no propeller will &lsquo;bite.&rsquo; The ceiling
has been attained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With jet propulsion, exactly the opposite holds
good. The less air there is, the more efficient is the
motor. If the ejected gas has an expansion efficiency
at rest of 40 feet in one-hundredth of a second&mdash;a
rate of 4,000 feet a second&mdash;the same force exerted
in motion would increase the speed up to a point
where the maximum efficiency is reached at something
like 10,000 miles an hour. Jet propulsion gets
better and better as speed and height increase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, with a fuel composed of
liquid oxygen and gasoline, jet velocities of 12,000
feet a second have been obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was one important question the article did
not answer. How was the plane operated? Could he
drop into the pilot&rsquo;s place, set the plane screaming,
and sail away at once? Jack wanted very much to
know. Already he pictured himself slipping into the
mystery plane and soaring away. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;we must get away from this island and back to
our ship. We can&rsquo;t miss the attack on Mindanao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added, catching his breath, &ldquo;what
a sensation I would create if I were to come swooping
down to land that plane on the deck of the old
<i>Black Bee</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d probably get myself shot up before I landed.&rdquo;
His face sobered. &ldquo;But that could be taken care of
some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to think what it would mean to come
into possession of such a plane. &ldquo;All depends upon
who those fellows are,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;If they are our
allies and I swiped their plane, I would very likely
be put in the brig. But if they are Germans, and I
got their secret weapon away from them, my picture
would make the front page of every paper in America.
I&rsquo;d probably be made an admiral.&rdquo; He laughed
huskily. &ldquo;What a life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>A protracted search was at last rewarded. An insignificant
sketch clipped from some British magazine
told him that it had not been necessary to
change the manner of operation for this plane. &ldquo;You
turn on the gas, release the brakes, step on the accelerator,
and away you fly,&rdquo; he read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he returned the book to its place on the rock,
then turned to go up the trail, he realized that
though the mystery of the strange plane had, in part,
been solved, that mystery had been supplanted by
even more important problems. Who were these
men who came and went so mysteriously? They had
told him very little. The book had told him less.
Since the clippings were printed in four languages,
and these men had collected them, they might be
friends or enemies&mdash;Englishmen, Australians, or
Germans. These islands were in enemy waters, but
were too small and rugged to be considered important.
Perhaps these men were Germans placed here
to spy on Allied ships and to watch the islands.</p>
<p>But in that case they&rsquo;d have nabbed me, he
thought. Well, maybe not. They knew I couldn&rsquo;t
get away. Perhaps they thought they could find out
things from me, the ship I&rsquo;d sailed on, number of
ships in the task force, and all that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>But then, they spoke English. He laughed lightly.
Probably Englishmen. But why are they here? He
gave it up and started back toward their camp.</p>
<p>On his way back to camp he made discoveries that
deepened the already ominous mystery of the island.
He had covered half the distance when a fluttering
bit of white against the dark trunk of a huge teakwood
tree caught his eye. He hurried toward it.</p>
<p>He discovered that it was pinned there by three
thorns. It was a note written on paper made from a
thin slice cut out of the stem of a palm frond and
bleached in the sun. The message was printed, but
not crudely done. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust those men with the strange plane.
We think they are dangerous. We have heard
them talking German.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was all. The note was not signed. Who were
&ldquo;we&rdquo;? To this there was no answer.</p>
<p>Jack felt a warm wave of friendliness sweep over
him as he pocketed the note. Some one on this island
wished to befriend him. A vision of the tall, slender
girl whose roast pork had so excited the natives, and
whose smile was most engaging, came before his
eyes.</p>
<p>She might have written it, he told himself. Then
again, perhaps not. There might be white people
hiding on the island. Who knows?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Suddenly, as he rounded a coco plum bush, he
caught a glimpse of that same girl. She was on her
knees at the foot of a great coconut palm tree.</p>
<p>Seems to be praying to the spirit of the palm, he
thought, as he watched her from the shadows.</p>
<p>He knew soon enough that his guess was poor.
The girl was removing dried leaves and palm fronds
from a spot at the foot of a tree. After throwing
aside a square of brown canvas, she carefully lifted
something white from its place of hiding.</p>
<p>Jack could not see what this was, but he was not
long in finding out, for the girl stood up and held
before her a white dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Army nurse&rsquo;s uniform,&rdquo; Jack whispered to
himself. He shuddered involuntarily.</p>
<p>In a twinkling, without removing her thin, one-piece
garment, the girl had the white dress on, and
a cap of white on her hair.</p>
<p>After that, attired as a nurse, she did a strange
little dance all by herself. Stooping over, she took a
small square mirror from the hiding place. This she
hung against the tree. Standing there, she surveyed
herself in the mirror. Jack too, caught a glimpse of
her face in the glass. Her dark face stood out
strangely against the stark white of her dress. There
was a curious look of animation and amusement on
her face. Once she laughed, then shook her fist at
the face in the mirror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Then, as her shoulders drooped in an attitude of
utter sadness, she removed the dress and nurse&rsquo;s cap,
to return them to their hiding place.</p>
<p>Realizing that she might come out on the trail
at any moment, Jack hurried past the spot while she
was covering her treasures. Jack hurriedly and
quietly put some distance between them.</p>
<p>His head was in a whirl. Who was this girl? Why
had she come here, and how had she come into
possession of the nurse&rsquo;s costume? It was all very
strange and disturbing. Dark forebodings took possession
of him as he hurried along over the damp,
heavily shaded path.</p>

<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MOSTLY MEMORIES</span></h2>
<p>Darkness was falling as the carrier <i>Black Bee</i>,
escorted by cruisers and destroyers, sailed
away from the scene of her latest triumph, her attack
on the unnamed island that meant so much to the
Allied cause on its way to Tokyo. Not one U. S. ship
had been sunk or damaged. Jap installations had
been smashed and the airfield taken. The Marines
had stormed ashore in great waves, accomplishing
the occupation of a greater part of the island with
a minimum of loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a great day!&rdquo; Kentucky murmured as he
sat with his fighter pals on the flight deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a big day,&rdquo; Blackie echoed.</p>
<p>The elevator trap opened and from below came
the sounds of voices and music. Men were singing
and radios blared popular music or announced more
victories.</p>
<p>The elevator rose. It carried a new fighter to the
flight deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for Ted or Jean,&rdquo; Kentucky rumbled, &ldquo;if
one of them comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if only one of them does come back,&rdquo; Red
agreed soberly.</p>
<p>It had been a truly great day. The men below
decks were happy and hilarious. But the trio on the
flight deck, Kentucky, Blackie and Red, were for
the most part silent. Ted was gone. No one knew
when he would be seen again, if ever.</p>
<p>Jean, too, was gone. He had somehow been lost
from his formation. Kentucky had heard him say,
&ldquo;I am being attacked by a superior force. Notify
my nearest of kin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Jean been joking? There was no way to
know. Men did joke in the midst of battle. That was
the one way of keeping your nerves steady.</p>
<p>Kentucky did not believe that Jean had been joking.
He had scant hope of ever seeing him again.</p>
<p>But Ted&mdash;that was different. Kentucky believed
that Ted had made a safe landing on the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The course we are taking,&rdquo; he said soberly,
&ldquo;should bring us in about two hours over the spot
where Ted went down. I&rsquo;m going to ask for permission
to make a search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night?&rdquo; Blackie voiced his astonishment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Why not?&rdquo; Kentucky&rsquo;s tone was confident.
&ldquo;Ted&rsquo;s smart. He&rsquo;ll know the sound of our planes
and he&rsquo;ll find something to use as a flare. If he&rsquo;s
there and I get near the spot, I&rsquo;ll bring him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count me in.&rdquo; Blackie made it three.</p>
<p>Darkness came down like a black curtain.
Through this curtain the task force plowed on.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our destination?&rdquo; was the question passed
from man to man. Mindanao was often mentioned,
but only one man&mdash;the Commander&mdash;knew what
lay ahead, and he wasn&rsquo;t telling.</p>
<p class="tb">On being told of Jack&rsquo;s discoveries&mdash;the book that
gave him so much information about the jet plane,
the note of warning attached to a tree, and the native
girl who paraded in an Army nurse&rsquo;s uniform&mdash;Stew
found himself torn between two desires: one
to fit out the Jap raft and leave the island immediately;
the other, to remain to help Jack try to commandeer
the jet plane and fly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a marvelous new invention,&rdquo; he commented
excitedly. &ldquo;Think of doing the stratosphere
at 500!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then dropping down upon some unsuspecting
Japs!&rdquo; Jack added.</p>
<p>In the end Stew decided that it would be wise to
put the Jap raft into condition for immediate escape,
if flight became necessary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what might happen?&rdquo; he argued.
&ldquo;If those men speak German, they could easily be
Nazis, and they may bring in a whole boatload of
Japs to hunt us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was not so sure of all this. Those men in
charge of the jet plane had been friendly enough
and did not seem like Nazis. Nevertheless he did
realize that it was best to be prepared for any emergency.
So, after a rather cheerless breakfast of cold
fish and coffee, they spent the morning putting the
raft in order.</p>
<p>When they returned at lunchtime, they found
that the bananas had not yet begun to ripen, so
they lunched on chocolate bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just you wait!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to have a real dinner tonight, if I have to run down
a wild pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly join you. In fact,
I&rsquo;ll even roast the pig. But you&rsquo;d better take the
fishline with you. There are worse meals than fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fish!&rdquo; Stew snorted. &ldquo;Just you wait and
see!&rdquo; However, he did take the fishline as they
climbed up the slope for one more look at their
island home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll charm one of those wild roosters into sitting
on my knee,&rdquo; Jack laughed, as he tucked the violin
under his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or some wild maiden,&rdquo; Stew joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of that!&rdquo; Jack replied, soberly.</p>
<p>Stew paused half way up the ridge to examine
some fresh wild pig tracks, but Jack kept straight
on, until he reached the crest of the ridge. There,
seated on the highest pinnacle of rock, he surveyed
the scene, and was enchanted.</p>
<p>Save for a few white clouds, the day was clear.
On the dark, blue water there was a slight ripple
that made it seem alive.</p>
<p>Off to the right and lower down he suddenly discovered
the small native village, a few tiny grass
huts clustered about a larger one. As he watched,
two long, slender canoes with outriggers shot from
the shore. He looked at them through his binoculars
and discovered that one was manned by two native
boys, the other by two native girls.</p>
<p>As the paddles flashed and the canoes sped away
in a wild race, he thought, if things should get worse
here, those people could take us to the next island,
or elsewhere. He glanced away to the south. It
couldn&rsquo;t be more than ten miles to that next island.</p>
<p>At last, charmed by the scene that lay before him,
he took up his violin and began to play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>He had once supposed that much of the music he
had known might by this time have escaped him,
but now, in this moment of rest and inspiration,
they all came back to him&mdash;&ldquo;Londonderry Air,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; &ldquo;O Sole Mio,&rdquo; and many others. How
long he played, he could not tell.</p>
<p>Had he paused to listen as he played, he might
have heard movements in the brush directly beneath
him. The snapping of a twig, the swish of a branch,
even the low murmur of a voice might have reached
his keen ears. At last, with a sigh, he replaced the
violin in its case.</p>
<p>Brings back memories of home, he thought, as he
sighed again. Here&rsquo;s hoping I get back there some
time.</p>
<p>Memories! How strange his life had been! Thousands
cheer, he thought grimly. Thousands had
cheered his music, and now he played to the rocks,
the birds, and the broad sea. But the war is a
thrilling adventure&mdash;he squared his shoulders&mdash;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it for worlds!</p>
<p>From the moment he had passed his tests and
joined the Navy, his life as a flying cadet had been
thrilling. He thought it by far the finest branch of
the service.</p>
<p>First had come his civil aeronautics training. An
instructor had taken him up and scared him almost
to death. Next time he went up, he was given the
controls and told to fly. And he had flown!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Two months of this and he had thought himself
a finished flier. He did not know then that he needed
to gain a great deal more knowledge than he had.
He had wanted all the world to know how good he
was, especially Mom, Pop, and the home-town folks.</p>
<p>The old home town was &ldquo;out-of-bounds&rdquo; for him,
but what of that? When he was given two hours of
free flying, he had headed for home, thirty miles
away. It had taken a lot of treetop clipping to get
Mom and Pop out to see him fly, for he had not
written them he was coming. He got them out at
last, and waved them a salute. Then he had flown
over the golf course where only a year before he was
a mere caddy. Stalling his plane, he had come zooming
down from three thousand feet to scare caddies
and golfers half to death, then had zoomed away.</p>
<p>Some of the older golfers who had never taken a
chance in all their lives, who had never flown a mile
nor been obliged to fight for their country, had
taken the number of his plane and threatened to
report him for reckless flying. Had they? He did not
know. All he did know was that he had flown gloriously
on.</p>
<p>Next came Iowa City. No flying there, but plenty
of study and hardening up. It was summer and hot
as an oven. The trainers were relentless. Marches,
races, hurdles, football, boxing, and all the rest he
took in his stride. He got a broken nose from football,
a black eye from boxing, and a sprained ankle
in high hurdles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>There was little time for social affairs and when
there was, one was almost too hot and tired to care.
One bright spot stood out in that whole summer&mdash;the
night he took the Commandant&rsquo;s daughter to
the banquet and dance given for his group as their
training ended. He remembered still her gay laughter
and the bright sparkle of her eyes.</p>
<p>He drew Minneapolis for preflight training. What
a camp that had been! He was flying again, real
combat planes. Formations, sham dogfights, night
flying, following the light of the plane ahead round
and round.</p>
<p>A truly great camp. A grand USO with bowling,
billiards, a movie every week, warm-hearted city
folks, and plenty of girls. How he had hated it when
the day came to pack up and leave.</p>
<p>And then there was the long, hard pull in Texas.
Some of the boys &ldquo;washed out.&rdquo; Jack was determined
not to let that happen to him. It did not.</p>
<p>He disliked the heat and the great, flat plains of
Texas, but most of the time he had been too busy
to notice them.</p>
<p>Before long it was time for that new suit of blues
and the brief ceremony that made him an ensign
and gave him his wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Deck training at Great Lakes, then a short leave
to bid farewell to the folks at home.</p>
<p>Those fleeting days in the old home town left
delightful, exciting memories. The good folks of the
little city had done their best to show him that they
really appreciated the sacrifices he must make to
fight for them. He even forgave the old golfers who
had threatened to report him when he had scared
them half to death on his flying visit to the golf
course months before.</p>
<p>When it came time to go he had told Pop and
Mom good-by at home because he wanted it that
way. At the last moment Patsy had insisted on walking
to the depot with him.</p>
<p>When the train whistled, she had put out a hand
for a good, honest handshake, and had said, &ldquo;Well,
so long old pal. Have a good time. Take good care
of yourself, and plea&mdash;please come back, for we all
need you so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patsy&rsquo;s voice had sounded a bit strange. He could
hear her still, &ldquo;Plea&mdash;please come back.&rdquo; It was
strange about him and Patsy.</p>
<p>He looked off toward the sun now hanging low
over the dark, blue sea, and at the green jungle at
his feet. Yes, this was a great little world over here.
He&rsquo;d like to come back some time. But just now,
how he&rsquo;d like to be back in the old home town!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">VOICES IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Jack dreamed until the sun was low; finally he
heard Stew giving the call of a parakeet, the
signal they had agreed upon.</p>
<p>He squawked in answer, then gathered up his
violin and went hurrying down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you going to do,&rdquo; Stew exclaimed
when they were together again, &ldquo;dream up there all
day and half the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; Jack laughed. &ldquo;But you have to take
time to relax, even in war, or you&rsquo;re likely to crack
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never crack!&rdquo; Stew was tired. &ldquo;Look what
I got for supper!&rdquo; He held up his catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish! Oh, boy!&rdquo; Jack made a brave attempt at
expressing joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be thankful for fish,&rdquo; said Stew, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d
been through what I have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Jack was curious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty. I saw a small porker and followed him.
He really looked young. But when he got all hot
and bothered he turned and squealed angrily at
me. And boy! His tusks seemed to be at least two
feet long. I went up a tree, which was a job in itself.
Anyway, there was a strange bird up in that tree. I
wanted to have a look at that bird,&rdquo; Stew ended with
a drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a rooster?&rdquo; Jack grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rooster came later,&rdquo; Stew sighed. &ldquo;He was
a dandy! But he refused to be caught. So&mdash;o,&rdquo; Stew
sighed once more, &ldquo;I decided on fish for supper.
And one thing more,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;While you
played the violin, I saw two huge, dark-skinned men
with six-foot spears all set along the points with
flying squirrels&rsquo; teeth. They were looking up at you.
They didn&rsquo;t spear you, did they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder they didn&rsquo;t let me have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably thought they might injure the violin,&rdquo;
Stew chuckled. &ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In silence they trudged down the ridge and
through the shadowy forest.</p>
<p>They approached their camp in the bright afterglow,
and in that sudden burst of light Jack thought
he caught a glimpse of a figure darting into the shadows
of a great mango tree. He could not be sure,
so he tramped on in silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you were so lost in your dreams you
never even heard that jet plane return,&rdquo; said Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;Did it
really come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure did. And do you know,&rdquo; Stew said
thoughtfully, &ldquo;their landing was so different from
the one they made the other day that you&rsquo;d have
said another pilot was at the stick. He made two
false landings, then zoomed up, and finally seemed
to come in straight from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he made it?&rdquo; Jack was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. I didn&rsquo;t see him land. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s voice fell to an excited whisper.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a glow of coals in our fireplace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; Jack was incredulous. &ldquo;I remember
putting the fire out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s burning now, all right,&rdquo; Stew insisted.</p>
<p>And so it was. There was a fire, and something
more, besides.</p>
<p>When the boys reached the spot they stood gazing
in speechless astonishment, for there, held over the
fire by an impromptu spit of teakwood, was a roast
of pork loin, done to a delicious brown and sizzling
in its own fat. Beside it, kept warm on a rack close
to the fire, was a stack of brown cakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brownies,&rdquo; Jack whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark brownies. Natives,&rdquo; Stew murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brownies, all the same!&rdquo; Jack insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>Stew tossed his catch upon a rock. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you
like to wait until tomorrow for your fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>The fish did wait, and the two boys sat down to
enjoy a feast such as they had not eaten in months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Stew,&rdquo; Jack said as he reclined
against a rock, with the blue-black sea before him,
&ldquo;I think we picked the wrong party to help us get
off this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Stew sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those natives have some swell outrigger canoes
that would take us to some other island in less than
an hour,&rdquo; Jack confided. &ldquo;I saw them. They&rsquo;re really
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we&rsquo;d just be on another island,&rdquo; Stew
drawled. &ldquo;What I want is to be sitting on the flight
deck of our ship hearing the engines warming up.
Or I&rsquo;d like to be down below where jazz music and
radios make night hilarious on the old <i>Black Bee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;d feel better if I were sure I could
leave this island in a hurry if I needed to,&rdquo; Jack
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what!&rdquo; He sprang to his feet. &ldquo;This
feast of ours came from the native village. It&rsquo;s a
peace offering. What do you say we go and smoke a
pipe of peace with them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o-o no! Not me!&rdquo; Stew did not move. &ldquo;They
might not be as civilized as you think. Don&rsquo;t forget
that girl and the nurse&rsquo;s costume. Besides, I&rsquo;ve got
something else I want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try out that radio we found on the Jap raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cranked it for an hour last night.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s interest
was slight. &ldquo;Not a peep out of it. But go ahead,
try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo; Stew walked away. &ldquo;Give my
regards to that head-hunter&rsquo;s queen,&rdquo; he added,
with a low laugh. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a regular pin-up girl, don&rsquo;t
you think? Tell her to put a ring in her nose and
I&rsquo;ll take her picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack joined in the laugh. Then, after tucking his
violin under his arm, he trudged away into the dark
forest and over the trail leading to the village.</p>
<p>Guided by his pinpoint flashlight he followed the
leafy trail, where his steps made no sound, and listened
to the croak of a great frog that seemed to
say, &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo; He dropped down into a valley,
where some startled porkers went snorting away,
then climbed again to cross the ridge and come
down on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooky business, following these trails at night,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Anything might happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>When he found himself close to the native village,
he went on tiptoe until the light of their campfire,
burned down to a dull glow, was practically in his
eyes.</p>
<p>No feast now. It was too late for that. The natives
were seated in a half circle. Close by the fire sat a
stout young hunter. His fine brown face, with its
gleaming white teeth, was a study. He was smiling
broadly as jokes were passed back and forth. Before
him lay a freshly killed pig. He had returned late
from the hunt, no doubt, and was recounting his
adventures. The others with one exception appeared
happy. The tall, slim girl sat by herself. On her face
was a look of loneliness, perhaps of sadness. The
people were talking in their strange native tongue.
The girl did not speak at all.</p>
<p>Then Jack did something that even to him seemed
strange. Slipping silently through the brush, he came
close to the girl and, more than half in shadow, unnoticed,
took a seat beside her.</p>
<p class="tb">At that same moment, two hundred miles away,
Kentucky, Blackie, and Red were out over the sea
in their planes. Having obtained permission to conduct
a night search for their lost comrade Ted, they
were on their way. Talking over a radio of very low
power that was not likely to be picked up at any
distance greater than 300 miles, Blackie was saying
to the others:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just about ten seconds more and we should be
near the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty or twenty-five is my guess,&rdquo; said
Kentucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be great stuff if Ted were still on his plane there
in the water and picked us up on the radio,&rdquo; Red
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance.&rdquo; Kentucky&rsquo;s voice was low. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
lucky if he&rsquo;s got his rubber raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted did not hear them, but someone else, vastly
excited, did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Stew, on the island, tinkering with
the Jap radio, cranked furiously as he murmured.
&ldquo;Now if only I can make them hear me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentuck&mdash;Kentucky!&rdquo; he called into the small
mike. &ldquo;This is Stew. Do you get me? Stew. Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky did not come in. He kept right on with
what he was doing. Stew could hear the three of
them talking, heard Red say, &ldquo;I think I see a light
off to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo; was Kentucky&rsquo;s excited answer.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose it. That may be Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure to be Ted,&rdquo; Blackie broke in. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Stew&rsquo;s Jap radio took on a sudden burst
of power to break through space and fall on Kentucky&rsquo;s
ears:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Kentuck! This is Stew! Come in, Kentucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky heard, and sat up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stew! Where are you?&rdquo; Kentucky came back in
a steady drawl. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;well, you might say we&rsquo;re back in the old
home town.&rdquo; Stew made up a code as he went along.
He didn&rsquo;t want those fellows on the jet plane to
understand, nor some prowling Japs, either. &ldquo;Remember
those three houses? Do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do,&rdquo; Kentucky growled. &ldquo;Continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I live in the biggest house&mdash;the middle
one&mdash;three stories&mdash;get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you.&rdquo; Kentucky thought he understood
that Stew was talking of three islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack is with me,&rdquo; Stew went on. &ldquo;Our room is
in the southwest corner. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get you,&rdquo; Kentucky came back again. &ldquo;All
okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Only we miss our boat. We&mdash;&rdquo; Just then
Stew heard Blackie break in. &ldquo;Kentucky, there is a
light. Must be Ted. I&rsquo;m putting on my landing
lights. Going down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right over you,&rdquo; Kentucky assured him.</p>
<p>Stew understood it all, and was silent, even at a
time when he wanted terribly to talk. And so, as he
listened, the minutes ticked themselves away, and
once again his radio went dead. Far away, Kentucky
was thinking, &ldquo;I wish Stew had talked straight. I
think he meant he was on the biggest of those three
islands, and on this end of it. But how&rsquo;s a fellow to
be sure?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LUCK, PALS, AND PROVIDENCE</span></h2>
<p>Scarcely had Jack seated himself beside the
slim girl in the shadows away from the campfire
when she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;d come. I have something tremendously
important to show you. First you must play
for these people, for they love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that she clapped her hands and at the same
time gave a sharp exclamation. Some native word,
thought Jack. He was startled by this sudden turn
of affairs.</p>
<p>The natives were on their feet in an instant.
Three brown warriors, doubtless misunderstanding
the call, seized their spears.</p>
<p>Like figures done in bronze, with the firelight
playing on their dark faces, these three stood there,
silent and alert, ready for action, as the girl said a
few words to them in their own language. Then the
men relaxed and a low murmur ran round the
campfire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Play now!&rdquo; the girl commanded, turning to Jack.</p>
<p>A louder murmur came from the natives as they
settled back in their places and Jack tuned his violin.</p>
<p>Deciding that some simple tunes would suit these
people best, the boy played &ldquo;Turkey in the Straw.&rdquo;
Pleased by their dancing eyes, he did the &ldquo;Arkansas
Traveler,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Deep in the Heart of Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he swung into &ldquo;Old Man River,&rdquo; the natives
seemed to sense the meaning of the song, for
their faces were somber and sad. But now some one
was singing the words.</p>
<p>He listened carefully. It was the girl who sang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing it all,&rdquo; he whispered. He started once more
at the beginning and she sang with him to the end.</p>
<p>After that he played on and on, wondering,
Where did this girl learn that song? She had said,
&ldquo;These people.&rdquo; Were they not her people? It was
mighty strange.</p>
<p>When the fire had burned low and some of the
native children were asleep at their mothers&rsquo; sides,
Jack put his violin away. Then, as if he were in
church and had preached a good sermon, the older
members of the group came forward for a solemn
handshake.</p>
<p>After a few words to the natives, the girl turned
to Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you a new way back to your
camp,&rdquo; she said in a quiet voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>A moment later, without a light, she was leading
him through the inky blackness of a jungle trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are only two of us, my pal and I,&rdquo; Jack
said to the girl after a time. &ldquo;We may get into a
tight spot any time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are in a tight spot right now!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the meantime, some distance to the south,
things were happening on the dark waters of night.
Catching the drone of airplane motors and recognizing
them as those used in U. S. fighter planes,
Ted on his raft had become greatly excited. That&rsquo;s
Kentucky and my other pals, he thought. They&rsquo;re
out looking for me. How can I signal to them?</p>
<p>A flare. The thought came to him at once. In his
emergency outfit were matches in a sealed tin. With
trembling fingers he opened the can.</p>
<p>But what could he use for a torch? He thought
of his gony. Its feathers would burn. But no. He
couldn&rsquo;t do that. His parachute? Yes, it would burn.
But what a waste. If other things failed, he&rsquo;d use it.
But meanwhile he&rsquo;d tie his shirt to one of the paddles
and light it. He wadded it tightly around the
paddle blade so it would burn for some time. He
lighted it, and moved it about in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes so little light. They&rsquo;ll never see it,&rdquo; he
despaired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>But they did see it. Soon Kentucky came zooming
down while the others circled above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! Am I glad to see you!&rdquo; Ted put out a hand
to Kentucky when the plane was down and he had
paddled to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes two of us!&rdquo; Kentucky gripped his
hand excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with the old <i>Black Bee</i> after all when we
make that big push!&rdquo; Ted exulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be in anything if you don&rsquo;t get busy
and climb up here!&rdquo; Kentucky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ll have to take care of my gony.&rdquo; Ted
reached down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Ouch! Quit it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ungrateful
creature! I should have used you for a torch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Kentucky asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a gony&mdash;an albatross,&rdquo; said Ted. &ldquo;He lit
on my head and now he bites me for the tenth time.
Give me a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kentucky held a light on it while Ted cut the
strap that held the huge bird. Then he tossed the
gony into the sea. &ldquo;I was keeping it for emergency
rations,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>Five minutes later he was in the plane, and they
were roaring away. &ldquo;Just one more incident in the
great war,&rdquo; Ted said. &ldquo;Some get rescued and some
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a matter of luck,&rdquo; said Kentucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence, luck, and pals,&rdquo; Ted added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more work of the same kind to be
done,&rdquo; said Kentucky. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got Jack and
Stew located on one of those three islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great stuff! How did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stew&rsquo;s got some kind of radio. Not very strong,
but I got him. He told me in a sort of code that they
were on this end of the biggest island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed. &ldquo;Going after
them is my job. Jack&rsquo;s from my home town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s keen!&rdquo; said Kentucky. They flew on.</p>
<p class="tb">At the same time, on the island, with the aid of
the girl, Jack was making a startling discovery. She
walked with surprising speed over the jungle trail.
Only now and then did she take his hand for an
instant to whisper, &ldquo;Over a log here&rdquo; or &ldquo;Up a low
ledge now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want the natives to know,&rdquo; she murmured
low. &ldquo;There might have been trouble if they
saw what you are going to see. I didn&rsquo;t want a fight&mdash;not
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; Jack wanted to ask, but did not.
What a queer girl this was! Her skin was dark, her
nose was rather broad, and her lips seemed thick,
yet she was surely not like the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Been raised by some missionary,&rdquo; he told himself.
He knew well enough that there were such
girls. He had seen some of them in the Solomons.
Some were nurses. He thought again of the nurse&rsquo;s
uniform hidden at the foot of a huge palm. Had the
girl been a native nurse?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up now,&rdquo; she whispered, gripping his hand.</p>
<p>They climbed straight up a rocky ledge. At the
crest she pushed him down to a place beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>He looked, then stared. Almost directly beneath
them, surprisingly close and all lit up by a near-by
campfire, was the mystery plane. Seated around the
fire were not two men, but five. Three were small,
the others large. Just then the two large men stood
up. One was tall and rather thin, the other short
and stout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the same men!&rdquo; Jack whispered in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;The three little
men are Japs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Japs!&rdquo; Jack could feel prickles at the back of
his neck. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger!&rdquo; came in a low whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MYSTERIES DEEPEN</span></h2>
<p>Standing beside the girl of &ldquo;Mystery Isle,&rdquo;
Jack stared down at the five men and the jet
plane in silence. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a ticklish situation,&rdquo; he
thought. He was glad he had established friendly relations
with the natives. He and Stew, with only
their sidearms, would be no match for those five
men.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s amazement at this turn of affairs was great.
He had been inclined to accept the men who first
had the jet plane as Englishmen or Australians trying
out a secret weapon. One thing was sure. This
plane was no haphazard affair built from parts of
other planes. It was brand-new and had been created
in some up-to-date factory. There were little
points about it that seemed to say, &ldquo;Made in America,&rdquo;
but if it had been, how had these fellows gotten
hold of it? It was a priceless possession, Jack
was sure of that, for he had seen it perform. He&rsquo;d
seen many types of planes climb toward the stratosphere,
but none had become a speck in the upper
air as quickly as this one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get my hands on it,&rdquo; he whispered
to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you, though!&rdquo; she whispered back.</p>
<p>Then the tall man nearest the jet plane did what
to Jack seemed a strange thing. After lighting a
large gas lantern that spread a white circle of light
all about him, he climbed to the plane&rsquo;s fuselage,
threw back the canopies, hung the lantern on a pole
propped against the inside of the cockpit, and then
began tinkering with the controls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly isn&rsquo;t afraid,&rdquo; Jack whispered to the
girl. &ldquo;Working in a flood of light on a strange island.
What an easy mark he would make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he does not know you are on the island,&rdquo;
she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t those other men tell him?&rdquo; he wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s words gave him the impression
that she knew more than she cared to tell.
&ldquo;The Germans are not afraid of natives,&rdquo; she went
on. &ldquo;Besides, they have machine guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the plane?&rdquo; Jack looked closely at the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, two. I have seen them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Jack unslung his binoculars. They brought the
plane and the men closer to him. A look of intense
concentration came over the boy&rsquo;s face. He watched
every move the man on the plane made, studied and
memorized the instruments on the board, noted that
they were fewer than on most planes, then gave his
attention to the controls.</p>
<p>As if conscious of the boy&rsquo;s intense interest, the
man threw on the power. The motor squealed. A
fine, misty smoke half hid the plane. The man threw
off the power. The mist drifted away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That plane has no propeller,&rdquo; Jack whispered,
half to himself and half to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s run by jets going out from the back,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;If you held a large balloon before you
and it exploded, it would push you over. That plane
works something like that. The Italians tried it.
Their jet went straight back out of the fuselage. It
ran the plane, but took too much fuel. This one
takes air from the sky into a large compressor. When
it is under high pressure it is mixed in a chamber
with explosive gas from kerosene. This mixture
is ignited under terrific pressure, then carried
round a right-angle bend and blown through fans
that somehow give it a lot more power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was silent. Did she understand? He
wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>But now the man in the cockpit was ready for
one more move. Once again he set the motor howling.
This time however he released the brakes,
dropped his lantern into the cockpit, touched the
accelerator, and went gliding away into the night.</p>
<p>Jack had watched his every move. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he
whispered, &ldquo;is about the easiest flying plane in the
world. I could fly it right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So could&mdash;&rdquo; The girl stopped, then added, &ldquo;Yes,
yes, I am sure you could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, too,&rdquo; Jack told himself, but did not say it
aloud. No use telling too much.</p>
<p>They listened to the plane until its strange wail
faded into nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; the girl said, half rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he will be back,&rdquo; Jack said, remaining
in his place. &ldquo;I want to find out all I can,&rdquo; he added.
The girl settled back in her place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fastest plane in the world,&rdquo; Jack whispered.
&ldquo;I have seen it take off in daylight. In the air
close to earth, it takes lots of fuel, but in the stratosphere,
where other planes can&rsquo;t travel because
there&rsquo;s no air for the propeller to bite into, this
jet plane goes like the wind on just about no fuel
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-o!&rdquo; the girl murmured excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;They left a scrapbook telling all about it down
there on the rocks,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I got a look at
it. Wish I&rsquo;d taken it with me, but you see, I thought
those first two men might be our friends. You don&rsquo;t
take books from friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Who
are you? Where did you come from? Those natives
are not your people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not my people,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;My home
is far away. When you need to know more you shall
be told. Is that fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair enough,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>The jet plane came screaming back. Jack watched
intently while the pilot put the ship to bed for the
night. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the well-beaten trail he said,
&ldquo;Thanks a lot. I&rsquo;ll be seeing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be seeing you,&rdquo; she repeated. He went one
way, she the other, into the night.</p>
<p>As he approached his own camp Jack saw no sign
of life there. The fire had burned out. Nothing
moved. All was silence and darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like returning to an empty house at midnight,&rdquo;
he told himself.</p>
<p>Dark forebodings took possession of his mind.
Had those original pilots of the jet plane told the
others of their camp here on the island, and had
the three Japs put an end to Stew&rsquo;s carefree life?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stew!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;Stew! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have those fellows hearing me,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to Stew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of a sudden there came the clatter of boots
on the rocks. Instantly he snapped out his light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, Stew?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is,&rdquo; came in a familiar voice. &ldquo;I thought
they got you for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Those jet plane fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The cannibals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget that cannibal stuff,&rdquo; Jack laughed.
&ldquo;Those people are our friends. But we&rsquo;ve got trouble,
all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Stew dropped to a place beside
Jack on the rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty. There are five men over at the jet plane
now, two Germans&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two Germans and three Japs, and they&rsquo;ve got
machine guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stew whistled, then he exclaimed: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good
thing Ted&rsquo;s going to look us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted? Look us up? Where&rsquo;d you get that idea?&rdquo;
Jack demanded in sudden surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got that Jap radio to work. There&rsquo;s been some
sort of fight. Ted was down in the water. Kentucky
and his crew located him. They were talking back
and forth, Kentucky and Red were, so I butted in.
I fixed up a sort of code and told them where to
find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I still don&rsquo;t see where Ted comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky located Ted and took him in his plane.
He left his mike open, so when Ted was in the
plane I heard him say, &lsquo;Now that I&rsquo;m rescued I&rsquo;m
going to find Jack and Stew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky said, &lsquo;That may require a lot of looking,&rsquo;
but Ted will find us, never fear.&rdquo; Stew drew
in a long deep breath of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;It will be great to get off this
island and onto the deck of the old <i>Black Bee</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Ted! He&rsquo;s a real pal,&rdquo; Jack murmured.
&ldquo;But whether he finds us or not, I&rsquo;ve picked my
manner of leaving this island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Stew sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in that jet plane,&rdquo; Jack declared
stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. As a prisoner of the Germans and Japs.&rdquo;
Stew laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my own,&rdquo; Jack insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! On your own.&rdquo; Stew did not laugh this
time. &ldquo;Two Nazis and three Japs with machine
guns! On your own! In the jet plane! No sir! Me?
I&rsquo;m going to wear out my eyes looking for Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SHIP FROM SOME OTHER WORLD</span></h2>
<p>Realizing that matters must soon come to a
head, Jack and Stew slept lightly that night,
hidden away among the palms. Anything might
happen on the morrow and they were prepared
for the worst.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on board the <i>Black Bee</i> Lieutenant
Commander William A. Brady, leader of the
Navy Air Force, was briefing his men.</p>
<p>Before him on the wall were maps and blown-up
air photographs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not tell you,&rdquo; he said to the bomber
pilots, fighters, torpedo men, gunners, radio men,
and all the rest assembled before him, &ldquo;what our
next great objective is to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a mingled murmur of words, &ldquo;Mindanao&mdash;Mindanao,
the Philippines. We&rsquo;ll give it to
&rsquo;em good this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, here we have it,&rdquo; said the air commander,
pointing at the map. &ldquo;Here is a map of the
Philippine Islands. And right over here at the extreme
east is Mindanao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go in here.&rdquo; He pointed again. &ldquo;Behind this
wide, deep harbor, where every fighting ship in our
Navy might ride at anchor, is a large city. There the
Japs have established a base of great importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is necessary that you study this chart with
great care. Everything is plainly marked. Here,&rdquo; he
pointed once more, &ldquo;is the air field, large enough
for our heavy bombers. Here is the dry dock, there
the docks for shipping, there the army barracks, and
here their supply depots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will each be given targets, and with your
bomb sights you should not&mdash;must not&mdash;miss, for
the people of this city are native Filipinos. You&rsquo;ve
heard of a brown boy named Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir! Sure! You know it, sir!&rdquo; came in a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in that city, a thousand brown boy Joes
and their families waiting deliverance from the Jap.
When our troops swarm ashore they&rsquo;ll be there waiting
to give the soldiers a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he pointed to a spot away from the city,
&ldquo;is the prison camp. There, housed in huts, poorly
fed and in rags, are hundreds of the boys who fought
so bravely at Bataan and at Corregidor. Each dawn
they face the sun and pray for deliverance. Shall
their prayer be answered?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>An uproarious affirmative came from the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there big Jap battle wagons, aircraft carriers,
and supply ships in that harbor?&rdquo; the Commander
asked. &ldquo;This we cannot know. It&rsquo;s up to the scouts
to tell us about that. And if they&rsquo;re there&mdash;&rdquo; he
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em!&rdquo; came in a big, hard voice.
&ldquo;They got my pal at Pearl Harbor. Nothing&rsquo;s too
bad for them!&rdquo; There came a roar of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have more of this as we approach the target,&rdquo;
the Commander promised. &ldquo;You will be given
smaller copies of this chart. I suggest that you memorize
it in detail. Much depends on this undertaking.
It may even be spoken of in the future as the
turning point of the war, for after Mindanao comes
Manila. From Manila we go to the China coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Tokyo!&rdquo; the big voice roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea! Yea! Yea! Tokyo! Tokyo!&rdquo; came like a college
football yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, and that, for the present, is all
I have to say,&rdquo; the Commander concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one more word.&rdquo; The Commander turned
about once more to face them. &ldquo;We shall not be
alone. We are to be part of what may be the greatest
fighting force ever assembled in these southern seas.
You should consider yourselves highly honored by
being made a part of this great fighting force.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>He moved away. There was no cheering now, for
this was war&mdash;and one of the solemn moments of
their lives.</p>
<p>As the Commander left the cabin his eyes fell on
Ted standing in a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations on your escape.&rdquo; He held out
a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I&rsquo;m glad to be back.&rdquo; Ted
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Jack and Stew?&rdquo; the Commander
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard from them, sir. They&rsquo;ve got some
sort of radio. They&rsquo;re on a small island not far from
the spot where we sank that Jap flat-top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! We&rsquo;ll be passing within a hundred miles
of the spot early tomorrow morning. Perhaps you
would like to have a try at rescuing them.&rdquo; The
Commander gave Ted a friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing would please me more, sir!&rdquo; was the
quick reply. &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s from my home town, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, but then you certainly shall have
the assignment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take off at dawn, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! And here&rsquo;s luck to you. Do your best.
We shall need those men in our next effort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring them back, sir.&rdquo; Ted saluted. The
Commander returned the salute, and they parted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if that was a rash promise?&rdquo; Ted
thought. &ldquo;Not if I can help it!&rdquo; He clenched both
hands hard, then opened them and flexed his fingers.
&ldquo;Have to relax,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s part
of the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was up before dawn. He gulped coffee and
doughnuts, and was ready for his plane, already
warming up.</p>
<p>Blackie and Red were there to see him off. &ldquo;Wish
we were going along,&rdquo; said Blackie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we, though!&rdquo; Red agreed. &ldquo;No such luck.
We&rsquo;ve got to lead some of those rookie fliers in
practice maneuvers. They&rsquo;re pretty good, but for
what we&rsquo;re going into next they&rsquo;ve got to be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mindanao, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Ted had one foot on
his plane. &ldquo;Mindanao seems to be what we were
born for. We&rsquo;ve dreamed of it for weeks now. Well,
so long, boys! Wish me luck!&rdquo; He climbed into his
plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long! Best of luck!&rdquo; Red called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and have a fine trip!&rdquo; Blackie added.</p>
<p>In his light, powerful fighter Ted climbed for
the clouds. There weren&rsquo;t many, but those he saw
were immense. &ldquo;Once you&rsquo;re inside one of those
babies you&rsquo;re as good as lost,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Climbing through one of these he soared away,
glorying in the wonderful beauties of the sunrise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heavens declare the glory of God,&rdquo; he repeated
slowly. &ldquo;And the firmament showeth His
handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night
unto night showeth knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we could read half the things written in the
skies we&rsquo;d be mighty wise, he thought. After that
for quite some time he sailed on, not thinking
much about anything, just storing up energy for
what lay ahead. And he was to need all the energy
and wisdom he possessed.</p>
<p>He had covered the greater part of the distance
to his destination, had picked out the island on
which he believed his friends to be marooned, and
was heading straight for it when he began to hear
a strange, low, screaming noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong with
my motor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shutting off the gas, he glided silently downward,
but still that strange sound reached his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my motor,&rdquo; he thought, sending his ship
shooting forward once more. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queerest
thing I ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puzzled and disturbed by this strange phenomenon,
he gave his ship a fresh burst of speed and
headed straight for his island goal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>With every second the peculiar howling sound,
which at first was little more than a whistle, increased
until it was like a fire alarm.</p>
<p>Thirty seconds had not passed before an airplane
such as he had never seen came shooting
out of a large cloud to go darting across his path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost its propeller,&rdquo; was his first thought. &ldquo;It will
crash into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When suddenly the plane banked sharply, began
to climb, and then came darting at him like a hornet,
his astonishment knew no bounds.</p>
<p>He was a good pilot. There were few better, and
he had a cool head. Giving his ship all the gas it
would take, he shot down in a vertical dive.</p>
<p>With plenty of altitude between his plane and the
water, he was safe for a second but what would happen
after? A glimpse of the plane as it shot across
the sky above him told that it carried no markings.
&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s plane,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;A flying Dutchman
of the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had he thought this than he realized that,
circling like a darting humming bird, the ship was
preparing to come at him again.</p>
<p>This time he resolved that in a way he should
hold his ground. Dropping a few hundred yards he
banked hard in an attempt to come up beneath the
plane for a try at a burst of fire. But when he
reached the spot the ship was some distance away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;Such speed!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Wonder if she&rsquo;s
armed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vain question. A burst of slugs swept across the
sky. Holes appeared in his right wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Declaration of war!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Well, then, I
accept the challenge.&rdquo; He began an all but vertical
climb to get above them in the hope of dropping
on their tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that creation has a tail,&rdquo; he thought with a
touch of desperation. &ldquo;A regular headless horse of
the air! No propeller, a sound like a siren. What
can you expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing he could expect was speed. They were
after him and climbing like the wind. They were
nearly upon his tail before he knew it.</p>
<p>Banking sharply to the left, he went into a terrific
dive. As he flashed past them they fired from
some swinging gun, and missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the island before they get me or
crash,&rdquo; he swore to himself. Then he saw a cloud. It
was just ahead of him, not large, but at least a haven.
He darted into it, and for the moment was safe.</p>
<p>But the enemy was persistent. The freak began
crisscrossing the cloud. Circle as he might, Ted
could not quite escape contact. There came the <i>rat-tat-tat</i>
of machine-gun fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shooting at my shadow,&rdquo; Ted guessed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a game two can play.&rdquo; Ten seconds later, catching
a dark streak passing through the misty cloud, he
released a burst of fire. The shriek of the enemy
plane changed instantly. Had he registered a hit?
He dared hope so.</p>
<p>But the fight was not over. The wild terror still
circled, its shriek becoming sharper and more piercing
each instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was such a plane as that,&rdquo; Ted
mused desperately. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supernatural, an inhuman
thing, the work of no man, but of the devil himself.
I&rsquo;ll dive and keep right on going, level off at
last, and land on the sea. It&rsquo;s my only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going into a steep dive, he found himself almost
at once in bright, tropical sunlight. The change
was startling. Like going to a party with no clothes
on, he thought.</p>
<p>He went straight on down, and the shrieker followed
him.</p>
<p>For ten desperate seconds he skimmed over the
sea. Then he hit it&mdash;<i>bump&mdash;bump&mdash;bump</i>. He
taxied along at last. Having shut off his motor before
his plane was at a standstill, he pushed back
his hood and plunged into the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>He was not an instant too soon, for again came
the rattle of the machine-gun fire. The enemy was
shooting up his plane on the sea, trying to kill him
while he was down. Ted, for the moment, was safe
enough. He had gone beneath the surface.</p>
<p>When he came up blowing, he saw the screamer
circle for another try. Then an amazing thing happened.
Some heavy object came hurtling down from
the enemy plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked himself. Then, &ldquo;Good
grief! It&rsquo;s a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The body hit the water with killing force, if indeed
the man was not already dead. It sank from
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty dogs!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed, when his head
had ceased whirling. &ldquo;They tried to kill me after
I&rsquo;d made a crash landing! Looks like one of them
got paid off, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MARY BROWN FROM THE U. S. A.</span></h2>
<p>Jack and Stew had heard Ted&rsquo;s battle with the
jet plane without seeing it. They had become
tremendously excited but were unable to do anything
about it.</p>
<p>Before Ted&rsquo;s adventure began, Jack was just sitting
up, rubbing his eyes sleepily after only three
hours of rest. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life on this island has become impossible. There
are five of those beasts against us. They have machine
guns and plenty of ammunition. We have automatics
with just the slugs that were in their chambers
when we arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the natives,&rdquo; Stew suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Germans and Japs would mow them
down like grass,&rdquo; was the quick reply. &ldquo;It will be
better for the natives if they&rsquo;re never discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be discovered all right,&rdquo; Stew declared.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hide for long on this island. It&rsquo;s too
small. I&rsquo;m surprised that those fellows haven&rsquo;t
hunted us down long before this,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t do that just yet.&rdquo; Jack drew
in a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;There they go, or at
least the Germans must be leaving. If they go we
should be able to handle the Japs.&rdquo; He had caught
the low whistle rising into a scream that told of the
jet plane&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could get my hands on that baby!&rdquo; Jack
exclaimed, thinking of the jet plane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fly her
right to the deck of the old <i>Black Bee</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get yourself good and shot up by your own
pals,&rdquo; Stew laughed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mark of identification
on that jet plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;But she does
carry a radio. I&rsquo;d announce my arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t got her yet. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stew stopped suddenly to listen. Jack cocked his
head on one side. Back of the high-pitched scream
of the departing jet plane they could hear the low
roar of an approaching plane of quite another character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ted!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Great Scott! I
hope he doesn&rsquo;t meet that jet plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a swell fight. Ted is really good. I&rsquo;d like to
see that fight.&rdquo; Stew&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ted is good, all right,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;But
something tells me that jet plane is a natural for
fighting. It&rsquo;s got amazing speed. Besides, I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s
as easy to handle as a bicycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later they went racing for the
rocky beach. The silence of their island had been
torn to bits by the rasping <i>rat&mdash;tat&mdash;tat</i> of machine-gun
fire. Since it came from the sea they guessed
that Ted had met the jet plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t Ted&rsquo;s gun,&rdquo; Stew said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Jack agreed solemnly.</p>
<p>The wind was toward the island. A large cloud
hid the battle, but every sound of it came to them.
Jack could picture it all in his mind. Ted&rsquo;s effort
to gain the advantage, the terrible speed of his enemy,
the flash of fire, the dip of wings, the sudden
downward plunges and the upward sweeps in an
effort to get on top&mdash;all this came to his mind.</p>
<p>With lips parted and hearts pounding, Jack and
Stew stood there in silence, listening. They knew
from the thunder and scream of the planes just what
was going on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if a pilot in a man-made plane
were fighting with one of those prehistoric flying
reptiles,&rdquo; Jack murmured huskily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reptiles all right,&rdquo; was Stew&rsquo;s comment, &ldquo;but
not prehistoric.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Jack held his breath as he heard Ted make his
dash for that smaller cloud. He understood perfectly
that Ted was heading for the surface of the sea
when he took his final plunge and sensed, with a
deep pang of regret, that the end of the fight had
come.</p>
<p>When once again they heard the short, sharp,
rattle of the jet plane&rsquo;s gun, both Jack and Stew
knew that there must still be something left on the
water to shoot at&mdash;realized, too, what sort of fighter
this jet plane fellow was, and at once vowed vengeance.</p>
<p>The two boys had stood in silence as the jet plane
sailed away. Not a word was said until the screamer&rsquo;s
motor was silenced for a landing on the island.
Then Stew muttered, &ldquo;The dirty coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said as they walked slowly back
to their camp. So downcast were they that they failed
to notice the smell of wood smoke rising from their
fireplace. Nor did they see the figure standing by
the fire until a voice said, &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled, they looked up to see the slim girl from
the native village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your breakfast is served,&rdquo; she said cheerfully,
pointing to a wooden bowl filled with hot fried
chicken, a board on which steaming cakes rested,
and a big pot of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Jack, smiling in spite of his disappointment
and grief. &ldquo;This really is a fine surprise!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;Japs,&rdquo; said the girl, picking up the bowl of
chicken, &ldquo;have an unpleasant habit of ambushing
people and shooting them in the back. How about
a little seclusion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me.&rdquo; Jack picked up the tray of cakes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
been a long time since I had fried chicken for breakfast.
Let&rsquo;s not be interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stew followed them with the coffee as they hiked
away.</p>
<p>In a shady, well-hidden spot among the palms,
the girl spread broad palm leaves for a table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Make a long arm and help
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get that expression?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; her brown eyes twinkled, &ldquo;that it was
in Kentucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky?&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Then you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting warm now.&rdquo;
She pulled wads of palm fiber from her nostrils and
from under her lips. They had been put there to
make her nostrils seem wider and thicker. Then she
drew a small bottle from a pocket in her native belt
to rub the brown from the backs of her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re an American!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just plain Mary Brown from the U. S. A.,&rdquo; she
said proudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get
here, anyway, and what&rsquo;s the meaning of the disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo; She hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d tell it to
you now, but first, you tell me if you can, what that
shooting was about out there on the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s face grew tense, &ldquo;that was a friend
of ours named Ted who tried to rescue us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was shot down by the Germans in the
jet plane?&rdquo; Mary Brown asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we think,&rdquo; Jack replied soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try to rescue him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he&rsquo;s past rescuing. Those fiends shot
him up while he was on the water.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s words
came slowly. &ldquo;Besides, we have no boat, no plane,
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget the native canoes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Would the
natives help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do anything I say. Besides, it will be a
good thing to put them to work just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Jack asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to keep them from knowing there
are Japs on the island,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;They hate the
Japs worse than snakes. Not long ago a Jap torpedo
boat came across a big canoe loaded with these natives
and killed every one of them, for no reason
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! Hurry!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed, swallowing
half a cup of black coffee. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out there and
have a look for Ted. He&rsquo;s the best pal we ever had,
and if those fiends got him&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish, but
the others understood.</p>
<p>By the time they had rounded up three stout canoes
manned by husky natives and made their way
around the end of the island, the large morning
clouds had dropped to water level and become rain
squalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo; Jack groaned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never
find him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know these natives.&rdquo; Mary Brown
settled back in the stern. &ldquo;They can find any living
thing on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be keen if they find Ted and his plane in
this rain,&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;That way, if his plane is still
afloat, we can tow it ashore and hide it in some cove
without being seen by the Japs or the Germans. And
then! Boy! If that plane can be made to fly we&rsquo;ll
leave your little old island, Mary Brown, and we&rsquo;ll
take you along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds wonderful to me,&rdquo; she laughed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll become the mascot of your carrier, or maybe
its jinx.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving the island in that jet plane.&rdquo; Jack
did not laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;How will you manage it?&rdquo; Mary asked soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;But you wait!
We&rsquo;ll manage it some way. It just has to be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short time Mary had her natives
in their canoes around the end of the island
and ready to undertake the search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STAR OF THE MIST</span></h2>
<p>For an hour, with the brown natives bending
their stout backs to send the canoes shooting
forward, they glided along through the mist. It was
not raining hard&mdash;only a fine spray coming down.
They were soaked to the skin, but no one minded
that for the air was warm.</p>
<p>Jack really enjoyed it. For a time at least they
were free from danger. The war seemed unreal and
far away. It was as if they had left it behind forever,
and he almost wished he had!</p>
<p>He thought of the folks at home, of his father
working harder than ever because there was a war,
of his mother doing her own work, helping the Red
Cross and selling bonds in a booth on Saturdays.
It was all very strange how a war started by a few
very stupid men could change the lives of more
than half the people in the world&mdash;strange and terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Mary exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;A star!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Jack looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not up. Over there!&rdquo; she pointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t see a star through the mist in the
daytime. You must be dreaming,&rdquo; Jack protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look! Look closely! It&rsquo;s rather faint, but
quite real. A white star!&rdquo; She was leaning forward,
straining her eyes as if looking for a vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed at last. &ldquo;I see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Star of hope,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d lived
on that island for two years as I have, you&rsquo;d know
what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years! You haven&rsquo;t been there that long!
It&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; He stared at her in unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;In this war anything is
possible. Listen!&rdquo; Her face tensed with memories.
&ldquo;I was on Corregidor when we surrendered to those
terrible Japs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corregidor?&rdquo; Jack gasped. &ldquo;Corregidor in the
Philippines? Say!&rdquo; His voice dropped. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
where the <i>Black Bee</i>, our carrier, is headed for
next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corregidor!&rdquo; It was her turn to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not Corregidor just yet, but the Philippines&mdash;Mindanao,
to be exact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Take me with you!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not on board ship yet,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
just hoping. But say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you
ever get way over here? Tell me about it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure I will.&rdquo; She leaned forward. &ldquo;I was a
nurse, and just before the surrender I was told by
a native that one of my best friends lay in a boathouse
somewhere along the shore. He was a flier and
had been badly wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slipped away to find him.&rdquo; She drew in a deep
breath. &ldquo;I found him and did what I could. He
lived six hours.&rdquo; She paused to gaze away at the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime the fortress was surrendered?&rdquo;
Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She went on. &ldquo;That same native came all
the way to tell me. They were wonderful, those
Filipinos!&rdquo; She paused again, to stare away at the
white star that every moment grew closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Jack prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The native told me that my friend&rsquo;s seaplane,
all gassed and ready, lay hidden in a tiny bay among
the mango trees. I went there. I could fly, not too
well, but enough to keep going. I climbed in,
started the motor, then flew away from all that terror.&rdquo;
She shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I headed for America. Of course,&rdquo; she laughed,
a sort of choking laugh, &ldquo;I knew I couldn&rsquo;t make
it, not all the way, but I did want to be nearer home
if I had to die. You know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack whispered. He knew. Every homesick
American boy in all this vast Pacific knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept going,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how many hours I flew. Then my gas ran low. The
sun was bright. I dropped down low to discover a
dark speck on a broad sea. It was a large native canoe.
I landed close to them. It was my only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took me in and brought me here. There
had been missionaries on the island, but they were
gone. They liked me, those natives, because I could
roast a pig just right and make fine cakes,&rdquo; she
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Japs might come at any time, the
natives painted me up, dyed my hair, and made me
the daughter of the chief. And now,&rdquo; she drew in
a long breath, &ldquo;here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and look!&rdquo; Jack pointed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your
lucky star. It&rsquo;s on the side of Ted&rsquo;s plane. It&rsquo;s going
to bring luck to you after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken the truth. The star that had shone
through the fog was the white star on a blue circle
that identifies American planes.</p>
<p>Their boatmen gave a few more lusty strokes, and
they were alongside.</p>
<p>And there, sitting on the fuselage grinning at
them, was Ted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;I start out to rescue you.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;And
now look! You come to rescue me and my plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your plane badly damaged?&rdquo; Jack asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I can see.&rdquo; Ted slid down into the
canoe. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a few slugs in her. Her tail needs
a bit of trimming. Three or four hours&rsquo; work should
put her in shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you taxi in?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taxi? Move? Make a noise? Say!&rdquo; Ted laughed
hoarsely. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d been attacked by a flying freak
as I was, you wouldn&rsquo;t even dare to breathe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jet plane got you,&rdquo; Stew put in. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what plane?&rdquo; Ted stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jet plane,&rdquo; Jack grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pushed about
by a jet of hot kerosene blown up into gas and
mixed with air. We know all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been flying it?&rdquo; Ted questioned. &ldquo;Perhaps
that was you flying it today! Well, if it was, I
think I got your pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not serious?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I am. At least about that fellow falling
out of the thing,&rdquo; Ted grinned. &ldquo;I got in a burst
of fire back there in a cloud. Then when they
came down to shoot me on the water, this Jerry
tumbled out. I sort of figured he&rsquo;d been hit and had
gone crazy, or something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good news!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;There
were two Germans and three Japs. Now there&rsquo;s only
one German. We should be able to handle them.
They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jap&mdash;Jappie!&rdquo; a grizzled giant among the boatmen
broke in excitedly. &ldquo;You think Jappie on our
island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, there are!&rdquo; Stew insisted. &ldquo;Three Japs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you think, Mary Brown?&rdquo; The old man
turned to the girl. &ldquo;Jappie on our island? Maybe
this boy he lie. What you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t lying,&rdquo; Mary said in a steady voice.
&ldquo;Three Japs came on that plane last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you not tell me? I go kill them!&rdquo; There
was an angry and puzzled look on the aged native&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it.&rdquo; Mary smiled soothingly at the
old man. &ldquo;You would have tried to kill them. They
would have killed you. They have machine guns.
You must not die, for you are my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-um-by I kill &rsquo;em.&rdquo; The old man settled back
in his place. &ldquo;They not kill me. You see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Ted was looking from one speaker
to another and then back at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; he asked in a low tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first of all,&rdquo; Jack put a hand on Mary&rsquo;s
shoulder, &ldquo;let me introduce Nurse Mary Brown.
She&rsquo;s a native of the South Sea Islands from Ohio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kentucky,&rdquo; the girl corrected.</p>
<p>That called for a lot of explaining. Jack was only
half through when Mary exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those beasts must have winged you!&rdquo; She
pointed to a splotch of blood on Ted&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a flesh wound, really nothing.&rdquo; He tried to
toss it off. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even feel it at the time. I&rsquo;ve
sort of got it fixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Mary, moving toward him.
&ldquo;But where I come from wounds don&rsquo;t stay &lsquo;sort
of fixed up.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s too dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Producing a small first-aid kit from beneath her
native dress, she went to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get this war paint off as soon as I
can,&rdquo; she confided to Ted as she worked. From the
tone of her voice Jack guessed that Ted had made
a hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look swell just as you are,&rdquo; Ted joked. &ldquo;I
doubt if I could stand seeing you all whitened up
and dressed in a nurse&rsquo;s uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see me that way all right,&rdquo; was her reply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my uniform safely hidden away beneath
a palm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Jack thought. &ldquo;One more perfectly good
mystery all shot to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>For all this, he realized that life at the battle front
had not lost its interest. Mystery and adventure still
lay before him.</p>
<p>Many questions remained to be answered. How
had it happened that two men who seemed to be
British left the island in the jet plane, and five&mdash;two
Germans and three Japs&mdash;came back? Were
those first two men Germans posing as Britishers?
Could they be renegade Britishers, traitors to their
country? Or were they loyal to their country, and
had the jet plane been stolen from them?</p>
<p>One more thing Jack wanted to know. Who had
manufactured that plane? In the scrapbook there
had been articles in four languages, so it could
easily have come from any of these lands. Of one
thing he was certain. Give him a chance at it and
he would fly that plane, first thing. And did he
want to try it? Oh man! Did he!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose it&rsquo;s a German plane of a design unknown
to the Allies, what a scoop it would be if I
could drop it down on the deck of the old <i>Black
Bee</i>,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Even if it were an American-built
plane, I would be performing a great service
if I snatched it from the enemy before they had
used it as a model.&rdquo; Yes, he must have that plane!</p>
<p>But first, he thought with a start, we&rsquo;ve got to get
Ted and his plane ashore before this mist clears and
that jet plane fellow is out after us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about getting this plane over to the
island?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We got canoes. We pull &rsquo;em. No fly
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;You fly &rsquo;em pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got the idea,&rdquo; Ted agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lines were attached to the plane; then with a low
chant the natives were paddling in perfect rhythm
and drawing the plane silently toward the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HOT CANNIBAL RIVETS</span></h2>
<p>Ted&rsquo;s plane was heavy, a dead weight in the
water. Progress toward the island was slow, but
the protecting screen of mist held on. Noon came,
and Mary produced cold meat sandwiches and bananas
for their lunch.</p>
<p>As Jack watched her give a banana to the monkey
perched on her shoulder, he caught the gleam of the
chain and the tag the monkey wore about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>your</i> dog tag the
monk is wearing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she flashed him a smile. &ldquo;What did you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost anything before I knew you were a white
girl,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you thought the natives had eaten me,&rdquo;
she laughed, &ldquo;and that all that was left of me was the
dog tag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, and your white uniform,&rdquo; he supplemented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So you saw me dig it out from its hiding
place!&rdquo; she accused him. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed, spying
on a lady while she tries on a new dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t too shocking. Besides, you were just
one more dusky maiden, and still are.&rdquo; He touched
her dark cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that will change,&rdquo; she replied soberly. Then
recited:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Turn, turn my wheel.</p>
<p class="t0">All things must change.</p>
<p class="t0">The blue eggs in the robin&rsquo;s nest</p>
<p class="t0">Will soon have wings and beak and breast and flutter and fly away.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Robins and appleblossoms and home,&rdquo; Jack
murmured huskily. &ldquo;Glorious thought! But I say!
You&rsquo;d better get that dog tag back on your neck,
for we are once more on our way to war, and unless
I miss my guess our next stop will be the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! The Philippines! Lead me to them!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, unsnapping the dog-tag chain from the
monkey&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>It was midafternoon by the time the natives had
dragged Ted&rsquo;s plane between towering rocks to a
small, well-hidden cove where they might make
needed repairs unmolested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here just as soon as we
can.&rdquo; Ted&rsquo;s brow wrinkled. &ldquo;Look! I&rsquo;ve got a chart
that shows the course our task force is taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the Japs like to get their hands on
that!&rdquo; Mary whispered when he had the chart
spread out on a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll eat it first.&rdquo; Ted was
deeply in earnest. &ldquo;Look. This is the way they are
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight away from here,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And straight for Mindanao.&rdquo; Mary danced a jig.
&ldquo;Please! Oh, please take me along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go&mdash;or none,&rdquo; Jack said seriously. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;d better get busy or we&rsquo;ll never catch up with
our task force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three boys pitched into the task of examining
and overhauling Ted&rsquo;s plane. At length Jack came
up with a very long face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have hit the water mighty hard, Ted,&rdquo;
he said soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I suppose I did,&rdquo; Ted replied. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t remember that part of the adventure very
well. When you&rsquo;ve been chased all over the sky by
a plane that&rsquo;s a freak and faster than anything
you&rsquo;ve ever seen on land or in the air, you&rsquo;re not
likely to notice a tough landing. Why? What&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Matter enough!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Your right wing is
half torn away. Some of the rivets are actually gone.
Many more are loose. You&rsquo;ll never get me up in
this kite, not until a lot of work has been done
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great guns!&rdquo; Stew exploded. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never catch
up with the <i>Black Bee</i> now! And that means we
miss the big show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that jet plane,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure!&rdquo; Stew scoffed. &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s got it? Two
Germans, three Japs, and two machine guns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One German, I think,&rdquo; said Ted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive
that one of them fell or jumped from the plane.
I saw him hit the water. Still,&rdquo; he added slowly,
&ldquo;there are four of them, and with machine guns&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you need for fixing the plane?&rdquo; Mary
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rivets,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Hot rivets. Got any in your
outfit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have.&rdquo; The girl did not smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
ask my dusky godfather.&rdquo; She hurried down to the
canoes, where the natives were having a sun bath.</p>
<p>The boys could see her talking to the men. They
found it interesting and amusing. She would ask a
question of the Chief. At once they would all explode
into wild talk. This would die down abruptly.
Then the Chief would say a few words to Mary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>This was repeated a dozen times. Then she came
rushing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have hot rivets, copper ones,
this big.&rdquo; She held up an inch-long section of wood.
&ldquo;Will they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing better,&rdquo; said Ted. &ldquo;But, I say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not say it, for she was away like a flash and
ten seconds later the natives in their canoes were
making the foam fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed. &ldquo;Hot copper
rivets in a cannibal village!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Ted. &ldquo;But I believe we&rsquo;ll get them
all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they did. Not half an hour had passed when
the girl and her dusky crew once more entered the
harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed at sight of their
heavily laden canoes. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get all that
equipment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have all it takes,&rdquo; Mary said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;A portable
forge with coal to fire it, a vise, an anvil, and
all sorts of tools. Where did they come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not go into that now,&rdquo; Mary replied in a
most professional manner. &ldquo;It was my understanding
that you were in a great rush.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Of course, we are!&rdquo; the boys agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s get busy.&rdquo; She motioned her
men to unload.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have rivets,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;but we
do have several sizes of copper pipes and these boys
will make you the finest rivets you ever saw&mdash;any
size&mdash;any length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this was no idle boast the boys soon discovered,
for in an incredibly short time the forge
was glowing and the anvil ringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope those Japs don&rsquo;t hear that noise.&rdquo;
Jack&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was Mary&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s a
high stone wall between them and us. But if they
did, and came over here without their machine
guns, we would be a match for them. My natives
took their rifles from hiding. There are six of them
with good rifles. And believe me, they can shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the natives to forge out hot copper rivets
of just the right size and the young airmen to hammer
them into place, the work progressed rapidly.</p>
<p>So busy were the boys that they failed to miss
Mary Brown, who had slipped away almost at once.
They failed, too, to note that night was falling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three more rivets,&rdquo; Ted breathed, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re
through. What luck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>At that instant Mary appeared at the crest of
a huge rock. Without speaking, she beckoned to
Jack.</p>
<p>When he reached her side he realized that she
was greatly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them you&rsquo;re going with me,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Say you&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack told them. They assured him that they could
finish the job by themselves in jigtime. Then
they&rsquo;d have a bite to eat.</p>
<p>As Mary and Jack vanished over a low ridge she
said in a low, tense voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you&rsquo;d like to fly the jet plane away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gripped his arm to silence him. &ldquo;There is
just a chance that you might if only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only you could beat that Nazi to the controls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Japs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The natives
were roasting pork. The Japs smelled it. They like
pork. So they came over with their rifles and took
over the village. The men were with you. If they
hadn&rsquo;t been, there might have been trouble. I told
the women to feed them and give them coffee. They
put a powder in the coffee. The Japs will fall
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great! But the German?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to find out right now.
It&rsquo;s not far. We&rsquo;ll be there in ten minutes&mdash;I mean
to the ridge&mdash;looking down on the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Jack caught his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can decide what is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they walked on in silence. Only once
Jack whispered, &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood still listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a motor, not like a plane motor,
but one on a boat. Guess I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they moved forward in the growing
dusk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TWILIGHT BATTLE</span></h2>
<p>They came at last to the crest of the ledge hanging
over the spot where the jet plane rested
on the rock beside the sea. Since the surface of the
ledge sloped, it was possible for them to remain some
thirty feet from the brink of the hundred-foot drop
and still see the plane.</p>
<p>Jack would have walked to the brink of the cliff
for a clearer view, but Mary pulled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It is still light. If that
man is down there he may see you. You&rsquo;d stand
out against the sky. Sit down here. We&rsquo;ll watch to
see if anything moves down there. There&rsquo;s a steep
path round this ledge. We can reach the jet plane
in two minutes.&rdquo; She pulled him to a seat beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one down there,&rdquo; Jack said in a low
voice after half a minute of silence. &ldquo;This is my
chance. We might as well go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Wait!&rdquo; the girl insisted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>A minute passed&mdash;two&mdash;three minutes. Jack was
restless. Darkness was throwing thin shadows over
the plane, half hiding it.</p>
<p>He rose and walked almost to the brink of the
cliff and stood there staring down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one,&rdquo; he called softly without turning.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant a bulky figure shot past the girl
and straight at Jack. Only the girl&rsquo;s quick, piercing
scream saved the young flier. Turning quickly, Jack
threw out his arms to meet the man head on and
to bring him crashing to earth close to the brink.</p>
<p>Realizing his perilous position, Jack fought desperately.
He was no mean fighter.</p>
<p>His opponent was larger and older than he and
slower in his movements. The battle raged over
the surface of the cliff. Now they were close to the
ledge, now away. Now Jack was up, and now down
again. This man was a beast. Once he bit Jack&rsquo;s
finger to the bone. He tried to knock him senseless
by banging his head on the rocks. Jack&rsquo;s head was
hard, but this beating made him groggy.</p>
<p>It was then that the big man snatched a knife
from its sheath to kill Jack. His hand was up. The
end appeared certain now. But suddenly something
hard crashed against that upraised arm. The knife
rang as it hit the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>The stout hardwood club swung by the plucky
girl&mdash;that for the moment had saved Jack&rsquo;s life&mdash;did
not stop with the knife. It came crashing down
on the German&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Stunned, the big fellow staggered to his feet, made
a lunge at Mary, and lost his balance. He fell to
the rocky surface and started to roll slowly down
the slope. Ten seconds later he had disappeared
over the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what happened?&rdquo; Jack rose groggily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ma&mdash;matter what happened.&rdquo; The girl was
a bit shaky. &ldquo;Come on back and sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where is he?&rdquo; Jack stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone for good. Come on,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
<p>They returned to the shadows. Having regained
his vantage point, Jack rubbed his battered head.
&ldquo;I must have practically gone out,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;What happened to that Nazi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty!&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;But nothing he did not deserve.
Besides, this is war, and war is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No picnic.&rdquo; Jack was himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He stood up, balanced himself for a moment, then
went through the motions of skipping a rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
a moment to lose. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Jack followed her over the steep, uncertain trail.
Since she was barefoot, native style, her feet appeared
to cling to the rocks. From time to time she
gripped his hands to whisper, &ldquo;This is a bad spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they were on the level rock, racing for
the plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Jack hesitated with his hand on
the jet plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He fell too far.
Couldn&rsquo;t possibly bother us now. I&rsquo;ll send the natives
to look him up later. But now, please hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She joined him in climbing to the plane&rsquo;s top.
While Jack dropped into the pilot&rsquo;s place, she
swung down into the gunner&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a whisper. &ldquo;This is an
American twinflex gun! I&rsquo;ve fired them often!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it loaded?&rdquo; Jack asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Keep a sharp lookout. Don&rsquo;t shoot
unless it is absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did trust her, more than she knew.</p>
<p>After pulling down his canopy he switched on
a pale light. &ldquo;Just like my old scout plane,&rdquo; he
murmured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>As he studied the instruments and controls his
amazement grew. At last he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, &ldquo;This is an American plane, every bit of
it. The instruments even have the makers&rsquo; trade
marks on them. How do you account for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>Cautiously Jack tried out the controls. He set the
motor whispering, that was all. He released the
brakes. They glided forward three or four yards.
He clamped on the brakes again.</p>
<p>As he tested the instruments Mary whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming down the trail. I heard a rock
rolling down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief!&rdquo; came back in a hoarse whisper.
&ldquo;The Japs! We may have to light out just as we
are! I&rsquo;m practically ready to give it a try!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said good-by
to the natives. They&rsquo;ve really been wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo; Jack did not finish. That&rsquo;s a woman
for you! he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wipe out the Japs if I must.&rdquo; She turned
the machine gun noiselessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I must be sure first. It might be&mdash; There!&rdquo;
Her whisper rose. &ldquo;I saw one of them duck
into the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come on out into the open so you
can get all three. We can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>He stopped short. From the foot of the rocky
cliff had come the call of a parakeet where no parakeet
should be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
Stew! Phew! What a close call!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pushing back his hood he answered the call. A
moment later Stew was climbing to Jack&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened,
anyway? I thought you&rsquo;d been killed, and here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t miss it by much,&rdquo; Jack broke in.
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re here, let&rsquo;s forget the talking and get
this jet plane into the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying here!&rdquo; Mary declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Must you?&rdquo; Deep consternation was registered
by Jack&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must.&rdquo; Her voice was husky. &ldquo;But not for long.
I&rsquo;ll come with Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t beat you to the gun,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Stew broke in. &ldquo;He told me
to hurry. He&rsquo;s all set, but said he would wait unless
he was driven off by the Japs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much chance of that,&rdquo; Mary laughed
lightly. &ldquo;The Jappies are being royally entertained
by my friends, and after that&mdash;well, you fill in the
picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long!&rdquo; She was on the rock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice having
known you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you in the air and on the deck of the
<i>Black Bee</i>.&rdquo; Jack gave the ship the gun. The plane
whistled. He released the brakes. She slid into the
sea. Giving her another spurt, he felt her rise into
the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty of fuel,&rdquo; he said to Stew.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just circle a bit and see if we can pick up
Ted and that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best thing to do,&rdquo; was Stew&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel a lot easier if Ted hits the old
<i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i> deck ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sort of prepare the gang for this freak,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;Not a bad idea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACK&rsquo;S NEW GUNNER</span></h2>
<p>In the meantime Ted was growing impatient.
Having taxied his plane through the gap into
the open sea, he had made a practice run and found
her perfect. Then he had sent the plane gliding
back into hiding.</p>
<p>But what had become of Jack and Mary, and now
Stew? When he heard the wail of the jet plane he
feared the worst. They had been killed or taken
prisoner. Only the fact that six husky natives armed
with powerful rifles were hidden away in the shadows
beyond his small harbor kept him there.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he heard a loud &ldquo;Yoo&mdash;hoo! Yoo&mdash;hoo!
I&rsquo;m here! Taxi over!&rdquo; He recognized the
voice. It was Mary.</p>
<p>When he slid in close to a flat rock he found her
surrounded by a score of natives. She was embracing
them and calling them pet names as if they were her
brothers and sisters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>At last, grabbing up a battered overnight bag and
Jack&rsquo;s violin, she called out a native word that Ted
thought must mean &ldquo;good-by,&rdquo; then made a flying
leap for his left wing, which very nearly touched the
rock.</p>
<p>From the rock came a roar of farewells. Then
two bronze giants leaped into the water to push the
plane away.</p>
<p>Ted set his motor roaring, slowed it to a crawl,
then sent his fighter gliding out onto the moonlit
sea.</p>
<p>A moment later, like wild birds separated for a
time, two planes&mdash;one a fighter, the other a freak&mdash;came
close to one another, then streaked away
toward the western night skies.</p>
<p>Ted was in the lead. From time to time Jack
banked this way and that, testing the jet plane. He
went into a short spiral, then righted the plane to
climb back into position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This is the smoothest flying
kite I ever hope to see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>He wanted to tilt her nose and aim at the stars,
to try out the plane in the stratosphere, but he
could not be sure of the oxygen, and besides, he
did not wish to lose contact with Ted. Ted had
the chart showing the course the task force was
taking. It would be easy to become lost on the
vast Pacific, to run out of gas and fall into the sea.
What a climax to an exciting adventure that would
be!</p>
<p>The sky had cleared. The moon shone in all its
glory. &ldquo;No trouble finding the task force on such
a night,&rdquo; he said to Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; Stew agreed.</p>
<p>They zoomed along until Jack&rsquo;s dial indicated
that they had passed the halfway mark in their journey.
Should overtake the <i>Black Bee</i> in another hour
at the most, he thought.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the plane ahead a transformation
was taking place. The battered overnight bag that
Mary had taken aboard contained all the small
civilian articles she had possessed before leaving
Corregidor&mdash;also her nurse&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
<p>While Ted watched his instruments, consulted
his chart, and thought of many things, her fingers
had been busy. First, to be sure, she had performed
quite an unfeminine duty&mdash;she had studied the
swinging machine gun before her, making sure that
it was properly loaded and that, if necessity demanded,
she could do her full duty by it.</p>
<p>Then she had turned to lighter tasks. A bottle
of dye-remover, which had been furnished her, came
first. This made her white again. After this came
face cream, a manicure set, and cosmetics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>When this was done, by worming and wriggling
like a snake coming out of its skin, she succeeded
in completing her transformation from a South Sea
native to an Army Nurse. That the transformation
was quite complete was proven by the &ldquo;For Pete&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo; that exploded from Ted&rsquo;s lips when at last,
having solved all the problems of the universe, he
turned to see if she were really there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smile!&rdquo; he commanded. She smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell. Thanks,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I just
wanted to see if you were real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was to know much more about that a few moments
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! I think I hear the roar of a heavy plane!&rdquo;
Mary exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>Ted listened. The drone of his own motor was in
his ears. He heard nothing else. &ldquo;Guess you imagined
that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Strange things happen to
you in the sky. There are mirages of sound as well
as of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply. The steady drumming was
still in her ears. She was tired. It had been a long,
exciting day. She wondered vaguely what they
would do with her when she got aboard the <i>Black
Bee</i>, if she ever did. She hoped there was a tiny
cabin where she could sleep forever and ever.
Thinking of this, she nearly fell asleep when Ted
exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that! The light of the moon blinked
out and there&rsquo;s not a cloud in the sky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s on now!&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it came right back, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s off again! No! Now
it&rsquo;s on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted did not answer. He was beginning to think
he knew what was up. He hoped the moon would
blink again. And he was not disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the moon! Quick!&rdquo; He was all excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out!&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look closer! There&rsquo;s a Jap snooper between us
and the moon. Now it&rsquo;s below the moon! Once you
get it spotted, you can see it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Jap snooper?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big four-motored flying boat looking for a
U. S. convoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;We have to get that one,
don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we do! Wonder if Jack&rsquo;s radio works?&rdquo;
Then, &ldquo;No matter. Don&rsquo;t dare call him. We&rsquo;ll get
after that snooper alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hair seemed to rise and stand up like
a fuzzy-wuzzy&rsquo;s, but she was game. &ldquo;Get them!&rdquo; she
hissed. She was thinking of the horrors of Corregidor
and Bataan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Giving his ship the gun, keeping an eye on the
giant&rsquo;s shadow, Ted began to climb. The big ship
was slow. They gained rapidly. At just the right
moment Ted came racing down upon the snooper.
They were almost upon it when Ted let out a burst
of murderous fire.</p>
<p>He shot past the big ship, swung back, felt his
way until the snooper was again between him and
the moon, then went straight at her. Again at very
close range he pressed the firing button. But what
was this? The gun fired a few shots, then jammed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bum outfit&mdash;not my ship nor my gun,&rdquo; he
groaned.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, to his astonishment, he caught
the <i>rat&mdash;tat&mdash;tat</i> of a gun behind him. It was Mary.
They were passing beneath the enemy. She was firing
the rear gun, straight up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Give it to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flashes of fire came from the enemy, but the shots
went wild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll swing about and meet them almost head
on,&rdquo; he said in a steady voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dip down just
in time and you give them all you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll do my darndest.&rdquo; She braced herself for
the ordeal.</p>
<p>They very nearly missed going low enough. It
seemed to Ted that they must have scraped the big
boat&rsquo;s keel, but Mary got in her good work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>And it was very good, for scarcely had they passed
on to safety when there was a great flash and an explosion
as the giant blew up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work! Great stuff!&rdquo; sounded in Ted&rsquo;s ears.
Jack was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep radio silence,&rdquo; was Ted&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>All the while Ted and Mary were engaged in
the fight, Jack and Stew had been standing by to
come in if they were needed.</p>
<p>Stew had been all for stepping in at the very
start, but Jack had ruled against it. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know
our ship, our guns, or our instruments well enough
to risk it,&rdquo; was his verdict. &ldquo;Besides, our capture
of this secret plane may be of more importance than
we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much help at the bottom of the sea,&rdquo; Stew
agreed.</p>
<p>The fight over, they got back into line, then
zoomed on through the night.</p>
<p>Ted was astonished when at last, flying high, they
sighted the white specks on the sea that would be
their task force. And a greatly reinforced one it
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three times as many fighting ships as we had
before,&rdquo; he said to Mary. &ldquo;Three carriers and scores
of cruisers and destroyers. This is it! We&rsquo;re off to
the big show!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is it!&rdquo; Stew was saying to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only part of it,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick up
two other task forces. In all there will be hundreds
of ships&mdash;more than you have seen in all your
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even at that, Jack was thrilled to his fingertips
at sight of this great battle armada. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back
on the deck of the <i>Black Bee</i> in just no time,&rdquo; he
said to Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With luck we shall,&rdquo; Stew agreed. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d
better let the gang know that we&rsquo;re coming in a
freak plane that eats no gas and carries no propeller&mdash;or
they&rsquo;ll be shooting us up for wild game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Ted to take the lead,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>So, breaking radio silence, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on in ahead of us and tell them who we
are, Ted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. I hope they believe me!&rdquo; Ted laughed
into his mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make &rsquo;em a speech, boy! Make &rsquo;em a speech!&rdquo;
Jack urged. &ldquo;And it better be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ted&rsquo;s speech was a good one, at least good
enough, for fifteen minutes later Jack and Stew set
the jet plane down quite neatly on the <i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i>
deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>It would have been hard to tell which created the
most excitement&mdash;Jack&rsquo;s freak plane or Ted&rsquo;s white
girl, rescued after having spent two years on a wild
cannibal island.</p>
<p>Mary dropped out of the competition rather
soon, for the ship&rsquo;s Commander carried her away
to a late dinner such as she had not known for two
long years. Then he instructed his orderly to attend
to all her needs, and to stow her away at last
in a small cabin behind the bridge, where she might
sleep as long as she pleased.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Donald Stone had been
asleep when Jack came on board, but an hour later
he came up to the flight deck. When he saw the jet
plane he stared, rubbed his eyes, and then looked
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack! How did you get it? And where?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>So, once more Jack told his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems almost unbelievable!&rdquo; said the Commander.
&ldquo;Before I was assigned to the <i>Black Bee</i>, I
was sent to England to study an English plane that
was an exact duplicate of this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is an all-American plane, sir,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;The maker&rsquo;s name is on each instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means we are considering going into production,
or would be,&rdquo; the Commander corrected,
&ldquo;if this plane had been shipped to us for a tryout.
But now&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;what are we to make of it? You
say the first men who flew it seemed to be British?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and the last two were Nazis. They even
had three Japs with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; the Commander said, &ldquo;we have
the plane. What to do about it, that&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to fly her in the big push!&rdquo; Jack leaned
forward eagerly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a natural for scouting and
bombing. No Zero could ever catch her. And in the
stratosphere she&rsquo;d bring you home faster than the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired? Had a hard day?&rdquo; the Commander demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically just rolled out of my berth, sir,&rdquo;
Jack grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll try her out right now. Night&rsquo;s the
time for that. We&rsquo;ll not be spotted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did try the plane out. Jack went up alone
at first with one pale light showing. The Commander,
watching and listening on the deck, was
sometimes on tiptoe and sometimes doing a jig as
Jack put the screamer through its paces. An ardent
enthusiast was the Commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! What a plane!&rdquo; he exclaimed the moment
Jack leaped from the cockpit. &ldquo;What a kite!
Have her gassed. I&rsquo;ll go get my flying jacket and
we&rsquo;ll go up together!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">JACK&rsquo;S JET PLANE WINS ITS WAY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used up all my kerosene, sir!&rdquo; Jack declared
in sudden consternation. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m quite sure
this jet plane won&rsquo;t run on gas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let that worry you!&rdquo; was the Commander&rsquo;s
instant reply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been around this
old flat-top long enough. You should know that we
carry a greater variety of goods and supplies than
you&rsquo;d find in a department store. We service the
entire task force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know. But kerosene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We carry that for land operations. You can&rsquo;t set
up an electric light plant overnight&mdash;you have to
go back to the lamp-and-lantern age. Besides, many
of the small island crafts burn kerosene in their
motors. We&rsquo;ll have a drum up from below at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing I want to know,&rdquo; said the Commander,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the range of this ship. I&rsquo;ve
heard they&rsquo;re hard on fuel. We&rsquo;ll have the boys
rig up a belly tank on your jet plane. Then you
and I will give the ship a good tryout together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay with me, sir,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just for fun, or to try out a new toy. I
want to warn you,&rdquo; said the Commander, &ldquo;that if
this jet plane has enough range she&rsquo;ll be the first
scout sent out over Mindanao. It&rsquo;s going to be
very important that we have accurate information
regarding ships in the harbor. With this plane you
should be able to get that information and come
back alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a great honor, sir!&rdquo; Jack replied soberly.</p>
<p>When the belly tank had been rigged and the
jet plane fueled, they took off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were sure of the oxygen equipment, sir,&rdquo;
said Jack as he set the jet plane climbing, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take
you to the stratosphere. There we&rsquo;d really have distance
aplenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can wait,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Climb to five
thousand, level off, then follow the course the task
force has just covered. Our fighters are maintaining
a night watch for snoopers, but if our fuel holds
out we&rsquo;ll cover a much greater distance than they.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Jack followed instructions, then, having set the
ship at an economical speed, settled back to think
of many things&mdash;of the island they had left, of the
three Japs, and of the German who had gone over
the cliff. He could easily imagine what had happened
to them. However, to guess how they had
come into possession of this American-made jet
plane was not so easy.</p>
<p>He thought of Mary Brown and Ted. Mary was
a good-looking girl&mdash;with her island brown off and
a touch of an American lady&rsquo;s war paint on. He
thought Ted had rather fallen for her. Had he done
the same? There was Patsy. There was always
Patsy back home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your fuel, Jack?&rdquo; the Commander asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look, sir.&rdquo; Jack studied his gauge.
&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;Under present conditions
we should do eight hundred miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all anyone can hope for. How do you
account for this ship&rsquo;s efficiency?&rdquo; the Commander
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, sir, it&rsquo;s my understanding that a
new alloy has been developed that will withstand a
very high temperature. Then the jets are deflected
by setting them at right angles to the air stream. Of
course,&rdquo; he demurred, &ldquo;I only learned a little&mdash;I
read it in a scrapbook. All I really know is that
this plane&rsquo;s got speed and can carry enough fuel to
take you places and permit you to do things,&rdquo; Jack
laughed happily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask of any plane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all anyone can ask,&rdquo; said the Commander.
&ldquo;But let me tell you one thing, son, if a cannon
ball or even a slug from a machine gun ever penetrates
the wall of the combustion chamber in this
plane, with all that heat she&rsquo;ll burn like a match!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s protected partially, at least, with steel plate,
sir,&rdquo; Jack replied soberly. &ldquo;But why let the enemy
get a crack at you when you&rsquo;ve got a ship like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; agreed the Commander. &ldquo;All
you have to do is turn on the oxygen and climb for
the stars. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commander broke off to listen intently.
&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Shut off that squeal and drift
down a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack silenced his engine. Then he heard it. The
thunder of a powerful plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snooper!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s up ahead some distance.&rdquo; The Commander
listened again. &ldquo;Coming this way. That&rsquo;s my judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good two hundred and fifty miles from
our task force, sir,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too close. Start your motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack obeyed. &ldquo;And now, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up speed. We&rsquo;re going after that big Jap
plane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir! You are a key figure! A hundred
planes, hundreds of men operate at your direction!
There&rsquo;s time enough to get back and send out a
patrol!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking no chances!&rdquo; the Commander
snapped. &ldquo;No single man is too important. If I
were unwilling to risk going with you in a flight
of this nature, I should not be worthy of commanding
a bomber, let alone all the planes of a
carrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this gun I have here?&rdquo; he asked in a
casual tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s first-class, sir. The same type of gun we
use in our own planes, and in top condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your gun?&rdquo; asked the Commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two fifty-millimeter guns in fixed position.
Having no propeller simplifies things, sir.
I&rsquo;ve never fought in this plane, sir, but I think we
shall take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we can&rsquo;t shoot the beggars down,&rdquo; the
Commander laughed, &ldquo;the wail of this plane should
frighten them to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they howled on through the night.</p>
<p>Twice Jack silenced his motor. Each time the
rumble was louder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the right track,&rdquo; was the Commander&rsquo;s
comment.</p>
<p>The third time, Jack said, &ldquo;Very close, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above or beneath us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beneath, I believe, sir,&rdquo; Jack answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! We&rsquo;ll run right above them. Then we&rsquo;ll
swing about and down, so we can get them in the
light of the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was following instructions and was, he
thought, just about over the snooper, when a strange
thing happened. A dim light shot squarely across
his path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see that, sir?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light! It crossed my path!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Yes, Jack thought it strange. Instinctively he
banked hard to follow the light, but already it was
circling. &ldquo;Coming back!&rdquo; His heart skipped a beat.
He felt for his gun grip.</p>
<p>Automatically charting the course of that mystery
plane whose light had blinked out, Jack cut
a slow circle. Suddenly, as his eyes caught a shadow,
he let out a burst of fire from both guns, counted
three, then fired again.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the sky was alight. The thing before
him&mdash;a Zero, he believed&mdash;had blown up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those snoopers carry fighter protection now,
sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could they?&rdquo; The Commander was amazed.
Then, &ldquo;Probably have a carrier not too far away.
Maybe others. We must keep a sharp lookout. But
we must have the big snooper all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, we must.&rdquo; Jack started jockeying for
a position that would give him a picture of the
snooper against the moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;No, now!&rdquo; And then
again, &ldquo;Now! There he is! I&rsquo;ll climb up to give
it to him in the tail, then I&rsquo;ll bank sharply right.
Perhaps you&rsquo;ll get a whack at him, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lost the big flying boat once more, then, suddenly,
there they were, right upon the enemy.</p>
<p>Once again his twin guns roared. He banked
sharply to catch the rattle of the Commander&rsquo;s
gun.</p>
<p>He caught something more. From behind came
the rattle of a Zero&rsquo;s weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another fighter!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>Putting his plane into a steep dive, Jack dropped
a thousand feet&mdash;then swinging, started to climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck! You&rsquo;re just beneath him!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Commander. &ldquo;Climb right on up and give me
a whack at him as we pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be a difficult shot. There was the danger
too that the Zero pilot had a pal. But up they
flew. And at just the right moment the Commander
poured murderous fire into the enemy, who, for
three seconds, had no chance of escape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>It was enough. He disappeared from sight, and
to Jack&rsquo;s nostrils came the stench of burning oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got him!&rdquo; Jack breathed. &ldquo;But the
snooper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bright spot over to the left,&rdquo; said the
Commander. &ldquo;Might be a burning motor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a burning motor of the big Jap ship. It
burned more and more until the whole plane burst
into flames and white parachutes bloomed against
the night sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the Commander, &ldquo;that we should
start back. There&rsquo;s such a thing as going too far
in this matter of testing out a plane&rsquo;s cruising capacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you say, sir.&rdquo; Jack spoke calmly, but inside
he was all pure joy. His jet plane had proved its
worth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRATOSPHERE TACTICS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do I fly this jet plane in the big show, sir?&rdquo;
Jack asked as he and the Commander stepped
down on the <i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i> deck half an hour later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; was the instant response, &ldquo;but
you&rsquo;ll lead the parade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the Commander ordered, &ldquo;hit the
hay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was too excited over past and future events
to sleep long that night. He awoke with the dawn
to find the sea blanketed in fog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what the doctor ordered,&rdquo; he said to Stew.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be able to get through the day unobserved
by the enemy. And tomorrow, unless I miss my
guess, we strike at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With coffee, hot cakes, and bacon stowed away,
Jack made his way to the flight deck. There he obtained
permission to take his jet plane below for
study, inspection, and if need be, repairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>He had plenty of help with this task. There wasn&rsquo;t
a flier or mechanic on the <i>Black Bee</i> who would not
gladly have taken the jet plane apart piece by piece
just to see what made it go.</p>
<p>The best mechanics on the carrier were assigned
to the task of going over the plane. With an eagle
eye Jack watched their every move. He made sure
that the oxygen equipment was in perfect order
and the tubes filled to capacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re flying with me,&rdquo; he said to Stew. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
to be the first scouts over the target. Those are
the Commander&rsquo;s orders. And we&rsquo;ll go there in the
stratosphere, fastest trip you ever made, if our jet
plane holds together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jake with me,&rdquo; Stew grinned.</p>
<p>That was a busy day on the <i>Black Bee</i>. Every
plane was inspected and given minor repairs.
Fliers were given last day-before-the-battle instructions.
Anti-aircraft crews went through dress rehearsals.
Every man on the ship was on his toes
and ready to go. No night before was ever like this.</p>
<p>That evening Jack hunted up Mary, who had
joined the Medical Corps in the sick bay, and retrieved
his violin.</p>
<p>To relieve his tension he went to the flight deck,
tuned up his violin, and then walked slowly back
and forth playing all the melodies he knew&mdash;while
with every tune memories of other days came back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>Then he locked the violin safely in its case and
wandered up for one more look at the jet plane
before retiring for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Jack and Stew were up two hours before dawn.
The hour that preceded dawn was their zero hour.</p>
<p>As they came down for their coffee they were
surprised to find Ted and Mary waiting for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d like to be with you at the last
meal before the big moment,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sure swell of you,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d want to do that if we were the ones to
go,&rdquo; said Ted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through
a lot together, all of us. But Ted, what&rsquo;s your assignment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it.&rdquo; Ted made a long face. &ldquo;Our
fighter squadron, Kentucky, Blackie, and the rest
are to stick with the ship just in case we&rsquo;re attacked.
Tell you what.&rdquo; Ted leaned forward.
&ldquo;When you get over that harbor just send word
back that there isn&rsquo;t a Jap carrier in sight and no
bombers on the airfields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Sure!&rdquo; Jack grinned. &ldquo;In fact, we&rsquo;ll do better
than that. We&rsquo;ll just circle around over the
sea, then make our report without even looking
at that old Jap harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say! What is this? Mutiny?&rdquo; Mary demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Stew grinned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a case of jolly good
lying &lsquo;just before the battle, mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short just yet,&rdquo; Jack said to
Ted. &ldquo;You may see plenty of fighting before this
day is over, yes, and find yourself in need of a
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;s gentle nursing,&rsquo; as the old poem goes, before
the sun sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zero hour came. The jet plane began its predawn
song. Jack and Stew were off.</p>
<p>The fog was gone, and the moon bright. Jack was
astonished as he climbed into the sky. As far as he
could see there were white dots telling of ships
plowing their way through the dark sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fighting ships than the world has ever
seen in one place,&rdquo; he said to Stew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;carriers, probably a dozen of them; big
battle wagons, cruisers, destroyers, cargo vessels,
transports, oilers, tankers, repair ships, PT boats&mdash;everything.
We&rsquo;re going back to the Philippines,
boy! And we&rsquo;re going back to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they soared again. With oxygen masks
in place they climbed to the substratosphere, then
headed for Mindanao at incredible speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; Jack breathed. &ldquo;No Zero will ever
catch up with us now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;d better not let them,&rdquo; Stew warned.
&ldquo;You remember the orders&mdash;no dogfights with those
cookies today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first faint streaks of dawn were showing when
a gray bulk close to the surface of the sea loomed
up ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Take a good look! It&rsquo;s
the Philippines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first glimpse of the islands,&rdquo; Stew murmured
with a touch of reverence. &ldquo;But not my last,
I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By studying his chart Jack learned that the land
ahead was the north entrance to a deep bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We follow the shore line until we are at the
center of the bay. The target is right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dropped to ten thousand feet, then slowed
down their plane and zoomed along over the shore
line.</p>
<p>They arrived at the target too soon for a clear
view. For all that, they found something to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nasty little Zero on our tail,&rdquo; Stew
exclaimed. &ldquo;Whatever shall we do?&rdquo; he asked in
mock terror. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wicked to fight, besides, we promised
not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on your oxygen mask,&rdquo; Jack commanded
with a grin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go up into the attic and talk
it over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>They began climbing steeply. The Zero pilot
came after them. They left his plane far behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast!&rdquo; Stew warned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if experiencing high altitude blues, Jack
slowed his plane down to a crawl. Encouraged, the
Jap put on full speed and came on for the kill.</p>
<p>But Jack, as if by some miracle, put on a burst of
speed to climb higher.</p>
<p>This was repeated four times. Jack was beginning
to wonder whether he was playing the game too
long with a plane he did not entirely understand,
when something appeared to go wrong with the enemy
plane. It began to wobble, then to smoke. It
lost altitude, then began turning over slowly. Faster&mdash;faster&mdash;faster
it turned as it fell, until at last it
was a mere black spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that this jet plane is the
berries. And now,&rdquo; he added in the next breath,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll just go down and see what ships there are
in the harbor. Get your pencil ready. Make the
count as accurate as possible. Can&rsquo;t tell about those
Japs. They might not give us another chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accurate it shall be,&rdquo; Stew replied grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, here we go.&rdquo; Jack tilted his plane.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come down so fast they can&rsquo;t intercept us.
We&rsquo;ll level off at two thousand and skim along
over the port and the bay. After that we&rsquo;ll circle
until the Zeros get tough, then we&rsquo;ll reach for the
stars.&rdquo; They were away, with their plane singing a
lovely tune as they rocketed downward toward the
port and the sea. To Stew, the speed of their downward
course was breath-taking, staggering; but he
hung on, offered up a prayer, and before he knew it
they were leveling off, gliding away, while he caught
his breath at sight of the ships in the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy! We caught them with their steam down!&rdquo;
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>His pencil was racing&mdash;two flat-tops, one big battle
wagon, five cruisers, seven destroyers. In vain did
he try to count the cargo ships and tankers anchored
in the harbor or tied up to the docks. &ldquo;Fifty or
more,&rdquo; he scribbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready for action!&rdquo; Jack barked. Ten Zeros were
coming at them. Stew threw back his canopy,
gripped his gun and waited.</p>
<p>Once again Jack started climbing. But two Zeros
were above and others to the right of him. Like
football players rushing to stop an end run, they
were coming in fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to fight,&rdquo; Jack decided. He headed straight
for the nearest enemy, caught him on the side, gave
him a burst of fire, then plunged down to go under
him. Luck was with him, for he came up behind
the other plane. The Zero fled without a shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>Jack did not follow, but again started climbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity! Such easy meat!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No dog fights!&rdquo; Jack reminded him. &ldquo;Besides,
there are eight more Zeros coming up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them come!&rdquo; said Stew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop the belly
tank on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was just what he did. When both they and
their pursuers were well up in the substratosphere,
he let go the empty tank and, with luck, tipped the
wing of a fighter, sending him whirling over and
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he breathed ten seconds later as the enemy
righted himself. &ldquo;We get no medals for belly
tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they climbed higher and higher their pursuers
one by one dropped back, giving up the race.
At last none remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their ships just can&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; Jack explained.
&ldquo;Something freezes up and then they&rsquo;re sunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or their propellers find the air too thin,&rdquo;
Stew added.</p>
<p>Tilting his plane, Jack drifted slowly downward
while Stew reported to the radio cabin of the <i>Black
Bee</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great work,&rdquo; was the commendation they received.
&ldquo;Think you can get down there once more
for a check?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go down again?&rdquo; he asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to five thousand,&rdquo; was the quick reply.
&ldquo;More would be suicide. You can use binoculars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down they went once more with the jet plane
singing its wild song.</p>
<p>Stew had just completed his check at five thousand
when Jack warned: &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he was above the enemy. When he had
gained sufficient altitude, he leveled off and soared
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Have to go back for
more fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again Stew radioed his report, with corrections.
Then he settled back with a sigh. &ldquo;Boy!
What a life!&rdquo; He was at ease, but not for long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XXVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE JET PLANE&rsquo;S LAST BATTLE</span></h2>
<p>They met a lone U. S. scout plane from another
carrier and dipped a wing in salute.</p>
<p>They had covered more than half the way to the
task force when, coming from behind a very small
cloud, Jack let out a howl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Torpedo planes in formation, dead ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enemy planes?&rdquo; Stew rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy. They slipped out of the harbor during
our stratosphere battles.&rdquo; Jack gave his ship the
rein.</p>
<p>The situation was clear. For many weeks Jap
task forces in harbors had been refusing to fight.
It had been assumed that they would once again
attempt flight. But at least one carrier had sent
out its torpedo planes to do battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on the radio! Quick!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Not
a second to lose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Almost the next breath Stew was droning into
his mike: &ldquo;Twelve enemy torpedo planes approaching
task force at top speed. Should strike soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His report exploded on the <i>Black Bee</i> like a
bombshell. Having received his earlier report, all
carriers had dispatched their dive bombers and torpedo
planes, with fighter escort, to the enemy harbor,
where they hoped to wreak havoc on the fleet
before it could escape.</p>
<p>On the <i>Black Bee</i> there remained only a small
fighter squadron under Kentucky&rsquo;s command. Half
the fighters were on patrol duty, the rest were on
the flight deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those torpedo planes hit us it&rsquo;s just going
to be too bad!&rdquo; Ted exclaimed as he and Kentucky
raced for their planes.</p>
<p>In the meantime Jack and Stew were shadowing
the enemy squadron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use taking them on alone,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! They&rsquo;ve got a dozen Zeros protecting
them,&rdquo; Stew agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they go after the <i>Black Bee</i>,&rdquo; Jack added,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re bound to step in and do our bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the <i>Black Bee</i> it is!&rdquo; Stew added a moment
later when the powerful planes, as if drawn
by a magnet, headed straight for the master prize,
the <i>Black Bee</i>, largest ship in the convoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to hand it to &rsquo;em!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got plenty of nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of good it will do them!&rdquo; Jack growled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wreck this jet plane in a suicide dive before
I&rsquo;ll see the old <i>Black Bee</i> sunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently Stew offered up a prayer for the <i>Black
Bee</i>, and for Jack as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Kentucky and his gang!&rdquo; he exclaimed
exultantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too few and too late,&rdquo; Jack growled. &ldquo;Curse the
Japs!&rdquo; Meanwhile Jack was edging in closer to the
approaching Japs. Stew was holding his breath, for
he knew well that if the Zeros turned to go after
him, Jack would not run for the stratosphere this
time, but would stay and fight.</p>
<p>Kentucky, with his small band of fighters, came
zooming on in formation. The Zeros dashed ahead
to engage them. At once there was a whirling battle,
as hard to watch as a three-ring circus. Three
fighters, Kentucky, Ted, and Red, remained in
formation. When a Zero went after them it was like
hitting a stone wall. Three Zeros went down in
smoke. But the deadly torpedo planes roared on.</p>
<p>Now, shaking themselves free from the Zeros,
Kentucky&rsquo;s three zoomed aloft to come in behind
the torpedo planes. Striking the last of these a
slanting blow, they sent it whirling and rolling
toward the sea. Two others followed in quick succession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>By this time the torpedo planes were nearing the
<i>Black Bee</i>. Ack-acks and pom-poms began pouring
bursting shells at them. Two were downed before
they dropped their tin fish. But the third, seeming
to bear a charmed life, came straight on. It dropped
its fish, then zoomed aloft.</p>
<p>With sinking heart Jack saw its torpedo tear a
gaping hole in the <i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i> side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get into this!&rdquo; he growled. Screaming
aloft he raced at tremendous speed past the enemy
planes, then whirling, came at the next torpedo
plane in line.</p>
<p>Just as he prepared to brave his own ship&rsquo;s fire,
the enemy plane blew up. A shell from the ship had
gotten her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work!&rdquo; he exclaimed, once again roaring
aloft.</p>
<p>Other torpedo planes were coming in. Kentucky&rsquo;s
trio was strafing them, but still they came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one hit so far. They&rsquo;re thinning!&rdquo; Jack
exclaimed. &ldquo;If my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s the one! We&rsquo;ve got to get that
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the Jap came whirling in. This time
nothing stopped the enemy, that is, nothing but the
fire from Jack&rsquo;s twin guns. The big plane nosed
down into the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s got them!&rdquo; Jack breathed deeply as he
passed out of range of the <i>Black Bee&rsquo;s</i> fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted crashed!&rdquo; Stew declared. &ldquo;I saw him go
down. Not a bad crash, but his ship&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over there to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jet plane banked, then sped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; Stew exclaimed.</p>
<p>A moment more and Jack&rsquo;s plane was taxiing in
close to Ted&rsquo;s wrecked fighter.</p>
<p>Ted sat astride the fuselage, which was all but covered
with water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not so bad,&rdquo; Ted replied, hesitatingly.
&ldquo;Sort of got a bump or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb over and help him onto our plane,&rdquo; Jack
said. Stew was on the sinking plane in an instant.
A moment more and they were rising from the
water.</p>
<p>Nearing the <i>Black Bee</i>, Jack signaled that he had a
wounded man and was coming aboard. He got the
all-clear at once.</p>
<p>The first person to reach the plane was Mary. She
had seen it all. There was a look on her face that
Jack had never seen there before as she called, &ldquo;Ted!
Is he badly injured?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pull through,&rdquo; Jack admitted. &ldquo;But why
only Ted? Can&rsquo;t you give another fellow a smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I could kiss you for saving Ted,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
And that was just what she did.</p>
<p>In landing on the sea, and again on the deck of
the <i>Black Bee</i>, Jack had experienced unusual difficulty
in controlling the jet plane, but was at the
time too excited to think much about it. When at
last he had time to look the plane over, he found
that it had, at some time during the fight, been seriously
damaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You picked up some of our flak,&rdquo; was the verdict
of the commander of the deck crews. &ldquo;That
plane&rsquo;s through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack came to his own commander to ask for
another plane, the Commander put a hand on his
shoulder and in a gruff voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, boy! You&rsquo;ve done your part. You&rsquo;ve
pitched five innings, and never a man got to first
base. It&rsquo;s you for the showers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>And so it was showers for Jack and Stew, and sick
bay for Ted, with a smiling Mary hovering over
him. But the battle went on. Every carrier sent its
full quota of dive bombers and torpedo planes to
sink ships in the harbor and wreck shore installations.
Speedy cruisers, destroyers, and PT boats
came in next to put on the finishing touches. After
these came troop transports and landing barges.
Marines and GI Joes swarmed ashore by the thousands.
By late afternoon they were ten miles inland.
The battle was won.</p>
<p>That was not all. They reached the prison camp,
knocked down the gates, and set free more than five
hundred prisoners who had not looked on the Stars
and Stripes for two long years.</p>
<p>Two hundred of the prisoners were put aboard
the <i>Black Bee</i>, for she would be the first ship to
reach Pearl Harbor. The hole in her side had been
shored up, making her safe for a journey, but not
for combat.</p>
<p>As Jack watched the prisoners&mdash;ragged, unshaven,
and lean-faced, with hungry looks in their eyes&mdash;line
up on the deck, he recalled a song he had sung
back in school days:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Tramp! tramp! tramp! the boys are marching,</p>
<p class="t0">Cheer up, comrades, they will come,</p>
<p class="t0">And beneath the starry flag</p>
<p class="t0">We will breathe the air again</p>
<p class="t0">Of the freeland in our own beloved home.</p>
</div>
<p>Others watched too. All of a sudden Mary let out
a cry: &ldquo;Tom! Tom! Oh! My dear!&rdquo; She threw her
arms about a slim, bearded youth who could have
been but a boy on Bataan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her brother,&rdquo; Jack whispered to Stew. &ldquo;She
told me about him. War is wonderful,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Wonderful and terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Black Bee</i> held her position for the night.
Early next morning, while Jack was pacing the deck,
he saw a small craft flying the Union Jack come
alongside. A rope ladder was let down and two men
climbed aboard. One of the two men glanced about
the deck. When his eyes fell on Jack, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! There you are!&rdquo; Staring, Jack made no reply.
Then suddenly he recognized the men. They
were the British pair he had first seen with the jet
plane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come for our jet plane,&rdquo; the man explained,
advancing. &ldquo;Those bloody Nazis and Japs
stole her from us. We went after them with a boatload
of fighting men, only to find that they were all
dead and that you had gone off with our plane. But
now here we are. Thanks for saving our plane, old
boy! That was bully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Gee!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s always
taking the joy out of life! I suppose there&rsquo;s no way I
can talk you out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; was the smiling answer. &ldquo;You
see, this jet plane idea was all worked out in England.
Then the United States asked for a chance to
develop it. They were given the right and manufactured
a few of them for experimental purposes. Australia
asked for one of these and got it. My partner
and I were given the task of testing the plane. We
were traders before the war and so had a few caches
of kerosene and other trade goods scattered among
the islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you were on our island,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly why. But those Germans surprised us
while we were on another island, and hijacked our
plane. Now I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to ask to have it
returned. However, we&rsquo;ve brought you a consolation
award.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Jack stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty sacks of first-class mail for the men on
your carrier. There should be a letter or two for you
in that lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a dozen, I hope!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;We
haven&rsquo;t had any mail for a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that there were fifteen letters for
Jack. The one he prized most came from Patsy. In
part it ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, Jack! Do take care of yourself and come
back soon. It&rsquo;s only since you&rsquo;ve been gone
that I&rsquo;ve learned how much you mean to my
young life. You&rsquo;re the only boy I ever really
cared for, and the only one I ever shall.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;That fixes things just
about hunkydory! &lsquo;Take good care of yourself.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;ve been doing. &lsquo;Come back soon.&rsquo;
Wouldn&rsquo;t I love it! Even just for a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Did a good gremlin whisper, &ldquo;Sooner than you
think&rdquo;? If he did, he spoke the truth. The old <i>Black
Bee</i> had been tied to the repair dock at Pearl Harbor
for three days. Ted, who was practically himself
again, and Mary, who was enjoying a new lease
on life, had been making good use of the Hawaiian
moonlight. One morning Jack and Stew were taking
in the sights, when Jack was called back to the ship
by his commander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your things together,&rdquo; the Commander ordered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going back to the States by plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, sir?&rdquo; Jack stared. &ldquo;What have I
done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty!&rdquo; The Commander smiled. &ldquo;It happens
you&rsquo;re the only living man who has flown a jet plane
in actual combat! Since our people are soon to put
this new type of plane into production&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want my expert advice, sir?&rdquo; Jack laughed.
&ldquo;Why not, sir? It will be a real pleasure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;You leave by plane in three hours, so you&rsquo;d better
start packing. Good-by and good luck.&rdquo; The
Commander extended his hand. &ldquo;The <i>Black Bee</i>
will be shipshape about thirty days from now. We
shall hope to have you back by then. And if you
can talk them out of about ten of those jet planes
for our carrier, I&rsquo;ll recommend your promotion to a
Lieutenant&rsquo;s rank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m as good as a Lieutenant right now,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s arm went up in a snappy salute and, executing
a right-about-face, he went off to pack; though
he hated the thought of leaving the <i>Black Bee</i> and
all the splendid men aboard, he could not still the
song in his heart as he visioned the excitement of his
next adventure.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
